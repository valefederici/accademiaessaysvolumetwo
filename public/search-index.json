But cross-referencing this evidence with a portrait still at the Accademia by an anonymous artist confirms the sitter’s identity as the female Roman printmaker and book illustrator, Girolama Cagnaccia Parasole (c. 1567–1622) (fig. 1).<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-3\"><sup>3</sup></a> A cartouche is inscribed with another variant of her name: “Girolama Parasoli Sc./1612.” The “Sc.” is for sculptor, as printmakers were described because they carved different media—in her case, wooden blocks to create woodcuts. Girolama wears black and a widow’s veil, which relates to the painting’s inscription of 1612, the year she lost her husband, Leonardo Parasole, with whom she had made book illustrations for local publishers.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-4\"><sup>4</sup></a> She was 45 years old when she became a widow, and she spent the next decade working on her own.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-5\"><sup>5</sup></a></p>\n<p>Giovanni Baglione mentioned Girolama in his 1642 <em>Vite de’ pittori, scultori et architetti</em>; however, he conflated her identity with that of her sister-in-law, Isabella Catanea Parasole, who had published numerous lacework pattern books, one of which had a frontispiece engraved by Francesco Villamena. Baglione wrongly had it that Isabella, not Girolama, had married Leonardo Parasole, and that they had raised a son, Bernardino, who worked with the painter Giuseppe Cesari. He also mentions her work on illustrations for a book about herbal plants and flowers, <em>Herbario nuovo di Castore Durante</em> (1585).<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-6\"><sup>6</sup></a> Baglione perhaps gave Isabella more prominence because her name survives on her many books’ title pages. By contrast, much of Girolama’s signed work survives as illustrations in texts authored by someone else, mostly antiquarians and ecclesiastics, which he neglected to mention, choosing to focus on subjects more socially acceptable for women—that is, lacework and flowers.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-7\"><sup>7</sup></a> There is no evidence Isabella knew how to carve woodblocks. Perhaps Girolama had been somehow involved with the illustrations in her sister-in-law’s books, though there is no evidence of this either.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-8\"><sup>8</sup></a> Baglione’s mistake published 20 years after Girolama’s death endured for centuries. Even after this contradiction had been noted by Giovanni Incisa della Rocchetta in 1957, addressed in 1995 by Alessandro Zuccari and Marco Pupillo, and later expanded upon by Pupillo in 2009, it sometimes persisted in subsequent scholarship.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-9\"><sup>9</sup></a> It is curious that Girolama’s portrait hung in the Accademia, documented by 1633, yet Baglione, who was active in the school’s governance and who might have regularly walked right past it, got her name wrong. He certainly knew the collection. In his <em>Vite</em>, he mentioned the existence of 24 portraits that hung at the Accademia and were listed on the 1633 inventory.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-10\"><sup>10</sup></a></p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Image header: Sofonisba Anguissola,</em> Portrait of a Woman, <em>c. 1560, oil on canvas.

Some inventories are organized by the topography of the space in which the works were displayed, or objects might be listed in categories assigned by the writer.

There were also 53 “portraits of painters and sculptors” mounted in black frames. The studio had originally been one large room, but by 1625 the physical space seems to have expanded into two rooms. The largest had many chairs, something like a lecture hall. The other space held sculptural fragments and casts, suggesting that this was the studio.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-16\"><sup>16</sup></a> In 1627 the current <em>principe</em>, Ottavio Leoni, initiated another inventory of the contents of the armoire in the studio above the church. There were by then 58 “portraits of several dead painters,” all but three of them in black frames.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-17\"><sup>17</sup></a> Six years later, the <em>principe</em> Francesco Mochi asked for a more detailed inventory of two rooms contiguous to the church.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-18\"><sup>18</sup></a> There we learn that nine round portraits of painters with black and gilded frames were observed. Further down the list are other “portraits of illustrious painters.” Important here is that these artists are described not as being “ancient” or “dead,” as in the previous inventories. In 1633 they are “illustrious.” This adjectival change acknowledges their didactic potential: the sitters were respected for their achievements, they had become models for the students to follow, and their number had grown from 58 to 69.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-19\"><sup>19</sup></a></p>\n<p>The earliest of these artists was Simone Martini. Michelangelo, Raphael, and Titian were the first three listed on the inventory, which conveys their fame and significance. Caravaggio and Annibale Carracci—though not easily traceable as academicians—were included, as was Agostino Carracci, who painted and made prints, like Antonio Tempesta (fig. 1.2). Girolama and Leonardo Parasole had often copied Tempesta’s work to make book illustrations and prints. Girolama’s, Tempesta’s, and Carracci’s portraits paralleled three northern European printmakers included in this hall of fame: Albrecht Dürer, Hendrick Goltzius, and Lucas van Leyden. A portrait of the iconographer Cesare Ripa was also included, and noted in later inventories of 1656 and 1658. But by the late 17th century, a subsequent inventory of the collection documents that it was no longer displayed with the group, and it is missing today.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-20\"><sup>20</sup></a> Francesco Villamena, whose portrait also hung at the Accademia, must have based his engraved portrait of Ripa on that missing painting, because its format closely resembles his many surviving portraits (fig. 1.3). It was subsequently used in the front matter of the 1625 Paduan printing of his emblem book, <em>Iconologia</em>.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-21\"><sup>21</sup></a></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-3\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-left\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"An engraving shows a man from the bust up, gazing directly at the viewer.

Although the editions of these books were not noted, Dürer’s <em>Four Books on Measurement</em> (1525) was there, as were two copies of Ripa’s book (first edition, 1593; first illustrated edition, 1603). Ovid’s <em>Metamorphoses</em> was on hand to consult for composing classical subjects. Sebastiano Serlio’s treatise, <em>Seven Books of Architecture</em> (1537–1575), was on the bookshelf, as was Leon Battista Alberti’s <em>On the Art of Building</em> (1443–1452). Giovanni Lomazzo’s <em>Treatise on the Art of Painting, Sculpture and Architecture</em> (1585) provided a theoretical text for studying visual art, and Baldassare Castiglione’s <em>Courtier</em> (1528) provided advice for interacting in a courtly context.</p>\n<p>An often-overlooked impact of early modern collections is their value as indicators of the means of educating artists. These three inventories show that fragmentary plaster casts of legs, arms, and torsos, as well as a model of the church of San Luca, were also available for study. There were plaster heads of Bacchus, Seneca, and a gladiator, as well as a torso of Venus. There was a copper copy of the figures from Michelangelo’s chapel, which could have been a printer’s plate. And available for study was an autograph Michelangelo sculptural fragment of a shoulder and part of a torso. Accademia members also donated paintings: an allegory of <em>Virtue</em> by Baglione, a landscape by Paul Bril, an <em>Assumption</em> by Ottavio Leoni, and an <em>Eve</em> by Baldassare Croce, all of which are thought to have been lost. These assembled items resemble a museum’s beginning, works that seeded the robust collection that survives today.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-23\"><sup>23</sup></a> They were images and objects to be viewed and to be handled, like today’s museums, which preserve permanent and teaching collections. These items would have contributed to the Accademia’s educational mission. Peter M. Lukehart has established the evolution of the Accademia’s pedagogical approaches that gained focus with Pope Gregory XIII’s 1577 brief in which it was declared that the academy’s mission was to “instruct studious youth in the practice of the arts.” A fully realized statement and accompanying statutes with its foundation followed on March 7, 1593. A look at the school’s teaching materials, then, can serve to fill in the gaps of understanding left by the rich documents of the Accademia’s <em>congregazioni</em> (meetings), which provide little insight into the theoretical or practical training for students. Romano Alberti’s <em>Origin and Progress of the Academy</em> (1604), however, provides a critical source for understanding the shape that instruction took during Zuccaro’s time as the first <em>principe</em>.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-24\"><sup>24</sup></a></p>\n<p>Studying this text, Pietro Roccasecca has inferred the Accademia’s didactic objectives, which had been conceived of as two entities: the academy and the studio, the latter of which was dedicated to educating young artists. These youth were ranked from beginner, to aspiring academics, and finally to studied academics, who could eventually participate fully in the intellectual life of the institution. From the ranks of senior members, instructors were chosen annually to hold a temporary position to instruct younger students, and every two weeks academicians presented <em>discorsi</em> (lectures) to peers and men of letters.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-25\"><sup>25</sup></a> Within the academy’s pedagogical context, then, the sculptural fragments and casts would have been deployed for hands-on instruction in the studio. The books would have been source texts for theoretical content, which might have been discussed in lectures. And all the while, the “illustrious” faces of the portraits silently gazed upon students and instructors who taught and learned in the school’s spaces.</p>\n<p>Visual art’s ability to inform young minds had long been acknowledged within a domestic context. The early 15th-century Dominican preacher Giovanni Dominici had written a treatise in which he advised mothers to display pictures of the Virgin and Child for moral instruction to the children in their homes.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-26\"><sup>26</sup></a> The casa/studio of the 17th-century painter Elisabetta Sirani operated as a domestic space, a place for socializing with patrons, and a studio for training artists. Inventories of this family workshop list drawings, prints, and plaster casts by Dürer, Carracci, and Michelangelo, and its small library shelved books by Ovid and Ripa.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-27\"><sup>27</sup></a> The same artists and authors documented at the Accademia in Rome were being gathered as teaching resources in Bologna. In Rome, elite palatial interiors were spaces that anticipated public museums, some even attracting a viewership not associated with the family, including students of visual art.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-28\"><sup>28</sup></a> Carefully chosen and thoughtfully organized things can form hierarchies and convey narratives that guide and teach the viewer. Gail Feigenbaum has observed that the history of art was worked out on the domestic walls of Roman collectors, who promoted artists’ works as much as Vasari had in the pages of his <em>Vite de’ più eccellenti pittori, scultori, e architettori</em>.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-29\"><sup>29</sup></a></p>\n<p>This approach of display as a method of canon formation by a pedagogical institution shows how the Accademia di San Luca was seeking to define artists’ education in a largely undefined field. The school’s walls were decorated somewhat like a Roman palace, the portraits engendering a formal and institutional atmosphere within modest spaces. This hall of fame originates from the custom of exhibiting <em>illustrium imagines</em>. Ancient Romans exhibited portraits as homage to their ancestors, and this impulse was renewed with more attention to Petrarch’s writing, especially his <em>On Illustrious Men</em>.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-30\"><sup>30</sup></a> Arranging chronological biographies was the organizing concept that Vasari had chosen for his 1550 <em>Vite</em>. Under Vasari’s influence, the 1563 ordinances of the Florentine Accademia delle Arti del Disegno declared an intention to display works of art in a frieze to document artists, beginning with Cimabue. And in 1568, Vasari illustrated the second edition of his <em>Vite</em> with artists’ portraits, each framed in <em>all’antica</em> architectural borders.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-31\"><sup>31</sup></a> The Accademia portraits follow a similar, albeit more austere, painted format, and Baglione, who modeled his <em>Vite</em> after Vasari’s, referenced many of them to document their existence as well as to justify his own choices to include or exclude artists in his book of biographies.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"snalez"}],"length":2132,"title":"The Didactic Potential of the Accademia’s Collections and Library","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/ParasolePortrait/I_didacticpotential/"},{"content":"<p>One guiding hand is not usually the case in institutional collections built over many years, but just who was chosen to appear in the Accademia’s gallery of faces must have been a subject of considerable debate at the academicians’ <em>adunanze</em> (meetings).

Inscriptions on the versos of Michelangelo’s, Dürer’s, Baccio Bandinelli’s, Adam Elsheimer’s and Jacopino del Conte’s portraits read that Leoni donated them in 1616.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-35\"><sup>35</sup></a> Leoni’s own portrait was not listed on the 1633 inventory, but his stepson, Ippolito Leoni, painted Ottavio’s portrait and donated it in 1633, according to an inscription on its verso.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-36\"><sup>36</sup></a> Leoni himself as the newly appointed <em>principe</em> had called for the 1627 inventory that listed 58 portraits, perhaps to learn who was already included and who might need to be added. Eleven more were counted six years later. This suggests that Leoni was a driving force behind expanding the Accademia’s portrait collection.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-37\"><sup>37</sup></a></p>\n<p><em>Principi</em> would have had sway in decision-making. Ottavio Leoni drew, engraved, and then painted a portrait of his father, Ludovico Leoni, which he donated to the Accademia, according to Baglione.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-38\"><sup>38</sup></a> Verso inscriptions on the portraits of Matthijs Bril and Bernardino Cesari document that their brothers, Paul Bril and Giuseppe Cesari, respectively, donated their portraits in 1622. A verso inscription on Luca Cambiaso’s portrait states that it was donated by Cambiaso’s student, Bernardo Castello, who likely based it on a self-portrait in the Uffizi.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-39\"><sup>39</sup></a> Understanding how some of these donors’ intentions led to the inclusion of men personally important to them can perhaps illuminate how Parasole—a woman working as a book illustrator in the commercial sphere—could have come to be included. Although not nearly as influential as a <em>principe</em>, Rosato and Bernardino Parasole might have influenced decisions to include a member of their family. Girolama’s brother-in-law Rosato appears in documents as a witness in the Accademia’s administrative meetings: one for the appointment of a procurator and another for the receipt of a payment. Girolama’s son Bernardino had been present at that 1624 meeting in which the <em>principe</em> ordered an inventory of the collection.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-40\"><sup>40</sup></a> Bernardino’s connections to Giuseppe Cesari and Cristoforo Roncalli make it likely that they would have also spoken in favor of Girolama’s inclusion. And Girolama and Leonardo’s working record of making prints and book illustrations after many of Antonio Tempesta’s images also makes it likely that Tempesta would have spoken on her behalf.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-41\"><sup>41</sup></a></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-left\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A painting shows a woman from the bust up, gazing directly at the viewer.

The error to choose this richly dressed woman as the model for Anguissola’s Accademia portrait discloses how she was perceived by the copyist far away in Rome. Her elegant appearance is somewhat in keeping with her position as a painter at the court of King Philip II. It appears, however, something like the visual equivalent to how Pietro Paolo de Ribera described her in his 1609 biography, saying that she had been courted by Spanish and Italian knights and had dressed as other ladies at court, wearing rich fabrics of gold and necklaces with jewels and pearls. As Julia Dabbs has observed, regularly repeated topoi that male biographers deployed when writing about female artists were not without their own inaccuracies and stereotypes.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-6\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-6\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A painting shows a woman from the bust up, gazing directly at the viewer.

By comparison, Parasole’s middle-aged face is quite un-idealized. Her mouth pulls slightly to one side, composed as if by someone who knew her personally, which is likely given that she lived in a neighborhood filled with artists who would have known her and her family.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-43\"><sup>43</sup></a></p>\n<p>Parasole’s inclusion stands out because her role in the commercial sector as a block cutter for Roman book publishers certainly differed from Anguissola’s success with patrons at court. Indeed the latter’s profession was more in line with the reverent ideals regarding visual art that had been promoted by the Accademia at its founding in 1593. The selling of sacred or profane images in a window or other public place was discouraged.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-44\"><sup>44</sup></a> The inclusion of these portraits of women artists, who died within three years of each other, convey a type of display attached to their biographies, whether known firsthand to academy members or perceived from a literary or historical distance.

Their portraits at the Accademia also rather epitomize the presence of women as <em>accademiche di merito</em>.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-45\"><sup>45</sup></a> They were included, but were far fewer than the men attending and teaching.

Her name has not been found in any other documents, but regardless she would have been banned from participating in administrative meetings, something that makes her inclusion within the Accademia’s portrait collection even more extraordinary: her portrait was displayed as a sign of the esteem in which she was held during the first half of the 17th century.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"snalez"}],"length":1705,"title":"The Portrait Collection’s Curators and Donors","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/ParasolePortrait/II_portraitcollection/"},{"content":"<p>This brief survey of the Accademia’s portrait collection reveals that multiple hierarchies were being narrated. A culture that exalted genius prevailed, as indicated by the 1633 inventory that listed Michelangelo, Raphael, and Titian first. Family relations of current academy members were also added, subtly promoting the paradigm that fathers and brothers were evidence of the innate ability of current members—a form of self-promotion by artists, some of whom saw to their own portraits being added later. But if artistic merit had been the only requirement for inclusion, then this art school’s mission to teach hard work and diligence to learn a craft also needed to be promoted. Parasole’s career certainly represented that ideal. Her work very likely did not hang in Roman palaces, like Caravaggio’s; instead, her inclusion reflected her contributions to publications that served the institution’s religious and educational mission. Perhaps Cesare Ripa had been included for a similar reason. Artists employed his emblem book as a source for composing traditional iconographic subjects and allegories. The Accademia had two copies of it in its library. Documentary evidence, in fact, tells that Leonardo Parasole had been contracted to cut blocks for illustrations in Ripa’s 1603 edition, the first to have images since its initial publication in 1593.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-47\"><sup>47</sup></a> There are no illustrations signed by Girolama for the Ripa second edition, but she signed one woodcut of “Giove Pluvio” in the <em>Annales Ecclesiastici</em> (1594) published by the Oratorians (fig. 1.7).<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-48\"><sup>48</sup></a></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-7\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-7\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A page from a book shows a winged, god-like figure with a long beard depicted at the center of the composition.

Underlying the institution’s educational mission was the church’s Counter-Reformation goals.

The finding of a great many artists’ names mentioned in primary documents is an important contribution of <em>The History of the Accademia di San Luca, c. 1590–1635</em>. By exploring the possible motivations for Parasole’s inclusion in the Accademia’s portrait collection, recognizing its didactic potential and acknowledging the esteem it would have conveyed to viewers, we can at least partially recover the reasons Girolama Parasole’s contemporaries felt she merited a place among the artists in the Accademia’s collections. At the same time, it is important to be attentive to the lived experiences of early modern women, which were not always autonomous and were constrained by societal and legal limitations. Despite these restrictions, a recently deceased female artist was included within that group of prominent male artists. This conveyed an important message. A teaching institution in early 17th-century Rome promoted Girolama Parasole as an “illustrious” artist—one therefore worthy of emulation.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"snalez"}],"length":1202,"title":"Recovering Early Modern Esteem for Parasole","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/ParasolePortrait/III_recoveryesteem/"},{"content":"<ol id=\"note-40\">\n<li id=\"note-1\">\n<p>Archivio di Stato (ASR), TNC, uff. 15, 1624, pt. 4, vol. 102, fols. 210r–v, 211r–v, 219r; ASR, TNC, uff. 15, 1627, pt. 3, vol. 113, fols. 27r–v, 28r–v, 41r–v; ASR, TNC, uff. 15, 1633, pt. 1, vol. 135, fols. 516r–v, 517r–v, 544r–v.

L’inventario del 1633 elenca, nello spazio di una pagina e mezzo, 69 nomi di effigiati corrispondenti a figure coeve e del passato lontano e recente<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-2\"><sup>2</sup></a>. Il tratto di penna del notaio alla fine del nome latinizzato di un’artista donna, Hieronima Parasoli, avrebbe potuto facilmente essere preso per una “o”, portando all’errata trascrizione di Hieronimo. Ma un raffronto tra questa testimonianza documentale e un ritratto anonimo tutt’oggi conservato all’Accademia conferma che l’identità della figura femminile raffigurata corrisponde a quella di Girolama Cagnaccia Parasole (1567 circa-1622), illustratrice romana specializzata nell’arte dell’incisione (fig. 1.1)<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-3\"><sup>3</sup></a>. Un cartiglio alla base del dipinto reca un’altra variante del suo nome: “Girolama Parasoli Sc./1612”, dove “Sc.” sta per <em>sculptor</em>, termine con cui venivano descritti gli incisori che lavoravano su diversi materiali – nel suo caso, matrici lignee da cui realizzare xilografie. Girolama è vestita di nero e porta un velo vedovile, elemento che rimanda alla data inscritta nel dipinto – 1612 – ossia l’anno di morte del marito Leonardo Parasole, con il quale aveva prodotto illustrazioni per editori locali<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-4\"><sup>4</sup></a>. Girolama aveva all’epoca 45 anni e nel decennio successivo iniziò a lavorare per conto proprio<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-5\"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Giovanni Baglione la menziona nelle sue <em>Vite de’ pittori, scultori et architetti</em> del 1642, confondendola però con la cognata Isabella Catanea Parasole, a cui si devono numerosi modellari di merletti, uno dei quali presentava un frontespizio inciso da Francesco Villamena. Il biografo riferisce che Isabella – e non Girolama – aveva sposato Leonardo Parasole, dal quale aveva avuto un figlio, Bernardino, che lavorava con il pittore Giuseppe Cesari. Baglione accenna anche al suo contributo per le illustrazioni di un volume su fiori e piante, l’<em>Herbario nuovo di Castore Durante</em> (1585)<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-6\"><sup>6</sup></a>. La ragione per cui viene dato più risalto a Isabella è probabilmente legata al fatto che il suo nome continuava ad apparire sulle copertine dei tanti libri di cui era autrice. La maggior parte delle opere firmate da Girolama, invece, sopravviveva nelle illustrazioni di testi scritti da altri, perlopiù antiquari ed ecclesiastici, che il biografo trascura di menzionare scegliendo di concentrarsi su soggetti socialmente ritenuti più adatti alle donne, cioè fiori e merletti<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-7\"><sup>7</sup></a>. Non esistono prove che Isabella sapesse intagliare matrici in legno. Forse Girolama aveva in qualche modo collaborato alle illustrazioni dei libri di sua cognata, ma anche questa è solo una supposizione<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-8\"><sup>8</sup></a>. L’errore di Baglione, le cui <em>Vite</em> furono pubblicate a vent’anni di distanza dalla morte di Girolama, si è prolungato per secoli. Anche dopo essere stato rilevato da Giovanni Incisa della Rocchetta nel 1957, essere stato evidenziato da Alessandro Zuccari e Marco Pupillo nel 1995 e poi approfondito dallo stesso Pupillo nel 2009, è ripetuto in alcune delle ricerche successive<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-9\"><sup>9</sup></a>. È curioso che Baglione abbia confuso il nome dell’artista: il ritratto di Girolama è attestato all’Accademia già nel 1633 ed è molto probabile che il biografo, partecipando attivamente alla gestione della scuola, gli passasse accanto con una certa regolarità. Inoltre conosceva certamente la collezione dell’Accademia, di cui nelle Vite descrive 24 ritratti elencati nell’inventario del 1633<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-10\"><sup>10</sup></a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Immagine di copertina: Sofonisba Anguissola,</em> Ritratto di donna, <em>c. 1560, olio su tela.

Esaminare i tre inventari della collezione dell’Accademia, redatti nell’arco di un decennio, è come sbirciare attraverso il buco della serratura di un’aula d’arte della prima età moderna. In genere, gli inventari sono prove documentali che offrono una sorta di testimonianza oculare sugli oggetti catalogati. Le descrizioni appaiono spesso sintetiche, ma possono svelare il rapporto tra ciò che è descritto e chi lo descrive. Alcuni inventari sono organizzati in base alla conformazione degli spazi in cui le opere erano esposte, mentre in altri gli oggetti sono suddivisi in categorie definite dal compilatore. Questi elenchi possono anche suggerire gerarchie di valore, per cui i nomi degli artisti più apprezzati sono generalmente collocati in alto<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-12\"><sup>12</sup></a>.

Cinque giorni più tardi, fu stilata una lista dei contenuti di un ambiente posto sopra la chiesa di San Luca, probabilmente il fienile<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-15\"><sup>15</sup></a>. Qui erano conservati molti oggetti, tra cui nove “ritratti di pittori antichi” racchiusi in cornici rotonde dorate e 53 “ritratti di pittori e scultori” sui quali erano montate delle cornici nere. In origine lo studio era costituito da un’unica grande stanza, ma nel 1625, a quanto pare, lo spazio era stato ampliato fino a comprenderne due. La più grande conteneva molte sedie e poteva quindi essere una sorta di sala di lettura, mentre l’altra custodiva calchi e frammenti di sculture, il che fa ipotizzare che si trattasse dello studio<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-16\"><sup>16</sup></a>. Nel 1627 il principe eletto Ottavio Leoni dispose di stilare un altro inventario degli oggetti presenti nell’armadio che si trovava nello studio sopra la chiesa. All’epoca si contarono 58 “ritratti di diversi pittori morti”, tutti – tranne tre – con cornici nere<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-17\"><sup>17</sup></a>. Sei anni dopo, nel 1933, il principe Francesco Mochi richiese un inventario più dettagliato delle due stanze contigue alla chiesa<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-18\"><sup>18</sup></a>. In questa circostanza vengono registrati nove ritratti di pittori racchiusi in cornici circolari nere o dorate, ma nel corso della lista si fa cenno ad altri “ritratti di pittori illustri”. Vale la pena sottolineare come, diversamente dagli inventari precedenti, qui gli artisti non vengono più descritti come “antichi” o “morti”, ma sono definiti appunto “illustri”. Questo cambiamento di aggettivo dà conto del loro potenziale sotto il profilo didattico: gli effigiati erano stimati per i loro successi e incarnavano dei modelli che gli allievi erano chiamati a seguire. Il loro numero, inoltre, era cresciuto da 58 a 69<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-19\"><sup>19</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Il primo in ordine cronologico è Simone Martini, ma i primi tre nomi elencati sono quelli di Michelangelo, Raffaello e Tiziano, a dimostrazione della loro fama e rilevanza. La lista comprende anche Caravaggio e Annibale Carracci – per quanto la loro appartenenza all’Accademia non sia facilmente documentabile – come pure i due pittori e incisori Agostino Carracci e Antonio Tempesta (fig. 2), del quale Girolama e Leonardo Parasole avevano copiato spesso le opere per illustrazioni editoriali e stampe. I ritratti di Girolama, di Tempesta e di Carracci erano affiancati alle effigi di tre incisori nordeuropei inclusi in questa galleria di figure illustri: Albrecht Dürer, Hendrick Goltzius e Lucas van Leyden. Tra i ritratti c’era anche quello dell’iconografo Cesare Ripa, registrato negli inventari del 1656 e del 1658. Un inventario più tardo documenta tuttavia che alla fine del Seicento esso non appariva più insieme agli altri e risulta oggi disperso<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-20\"><sup>20</sup></a>. Probabilmente è su questo dipinto mancante che Francesco Villamena, a sua volta rappresentato nella galleria dell’Accademia, basò l’immagine incisa di Ripa, il cui formato ricorda da vicino i tanti ritratti di sua mano giunti fino a noi (fig. 3). L’incisione fu successivamente utilizzata sul frontespizio dell’edizione padovana dell’<em>Iconologia</em>, la raccolta di emblemi pubblicata da Ripa nel 1625<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-21\"><sup>21</sup></a>.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-3it\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-left\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-3it\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Un uomo è raffigurato a mezzo busto, con lo sguardo rivolto direttamente verso chi osserva.

Nella biblioteca si trovavano anche gli scritti di alcuni degli artisti i cui ritratti erano esposti all’Accademia, sebbene le edizioni di quei libri non fossero indicate: tra essi, figuravano i <em>Quattro libri sulle proporzioni del corpo umano</em> di Dürer (1525) e due copie del volume di Ripa (prima edizione, 1593; prima edizione illustrata, 1603). Le <em>Metamorfosi</em> di Ovidio, opera di consultazione per la composizione di soggetti classici, così come i <em>Sette libri dell’architettura</em> di Sebastiano Serlio (1537-1575) e <em>L’arte di costruire</em> di Leon Battista Alberti (1443-1452), erano a portata di mano sugli scaffali. Il <em>Trattato dell’arte della pittura, scultura ed architettura</em> di Giovanni Lomazzo (1585) costituiva una base teorica per lo studio delle arti visive, mentre <em>Il cortegiano</em> di Baldassare Castiglione (1528) forniva suggerimenti sui comportamenti da tenere negli ambienti di corte.</p>\n<p>Un aspetto spesso trascurato delle collezioni della prima età moderna riguarda le indicazioni che sono in grado di fornire sui metodi di formazione degli artisti. Da questi tre inventari emerge come gli allievi avessero a disposizione per lo studio anche frammenti di calchi in gesso di gambe, braccia e torsi, nonché un modello della chiesa di San Luca. Tra gli oggetti in elenco figurano teste in gesso di Bacco, di Seneca e di un gladiatore, un busto di Venere, una copia in rame delle figure michelangiolesche che popolano la Cappella Sistina – forse la lastra su cui aveva lavorato un incisore – e persino il frammento di una spalla e parte di un busto scolpiti da Michelangelo stesso. Vi erano poi i dipinti donati da membri dell’Accademia: un’allegoria della <em>Virtù</em> di Baglione, un paesaggio di Paul Bril, un’<em>Assunzione</em> di Ottavio Leoni e un’<em>Eva</em> di Baldassarre Croce, tutti ritenuti perduti. Questa raccolta di oggetti rappresenta una sorta di nucleo museale inziale su cui è stata costruita la ricca collezione giunta fino a noi<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-23\"><sup>23</sup></a>. Si trattava di immagini e manufatti da osservare e toccare come nelle collezioni permanenti e didattiche dei musei odierni, elementi che avrebbero contribuito alla missione formativa dell’Accademia. Peter M. Lukehart ha ricostruito l’evoluzione degli approcci pedagogici dell’istituzione, delineati da papa Gregorio XIII nel breve del 1577 in cui si dichiarava che l’Accademia aveva il compito di “educare i giovani studiosi alla pratica delle arti”. A questo scritto sarebbero seguiti, il 7 marzo 1593, una dichiarazione compiuta con i relativi statuti e la fondazione. Una breve disamina dei materiali didattici della scuola può servire, allora, a colmare le lacune lasciate dalla pur ricca documentazione delle “congregazioni” (incontri) dell’Accademia, che offre però scarse notizie sulla formazione teorica o pratica degli allievi. L’<em>Origine et progresso dell’Academia</em> (1604) di Romano Alberti fornisce tuttavia una fonte critica per comprendere com’era strutturato l’insegnamento nel periodo in cui Zuccaro rivestì la carica di primo principe<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-24\"><sup>24</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Da un’analisi del testo, Pietro Roccasecca ha potuto ricostruire gli obiettivi didattici dell’Accademia, che era concepita come una duplice entità: da una parte l’accademia e dall’altra lo studio, quest’ultimo dedicato alla formazione dei giovani artisti. Questi venivano classificati in principianti, “accademici desiderosi” e “accademici studiosi”, i quali potevano partecipare pienamente alla vita intellettuale dell’istituzione. Tra i membri più esperti venivano scelti ogni anno dei maestri con incarichi temporanei per formare gli allievi più giovani, e ogni due settimane gli accademici tenevano un discorso di fronte a colleghi e letterati<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-25\"><sup>25</sup></a>. Nel contesto pedagogico dell’accademia, quindi, i calchi e i frammenti scultorei venivano usati per lo studio pratico, mentre i libri fungevano da testi di riferimento per i contenuti teorici, eventualmente discussi nelle lezioni. Tutto questo mentre le attività di docenti e allievi all’interno della scuola si svolgevano sotto lo sguardo silenzioso dei volti “illustri” esposti nella galleria.</p>\n<p>L’influenza delle arti visive sulle giovani menti in ambito famigliare era riconosciuta da tempo. All’inizio del Quattrocento, il predicatore domenicano Giovanni Dominici aveva scritto un trattato in cui consigliava alle madri di esporre immagini della Madonna col Bambino in casa per imprimere un’educazione morale ai pargoli<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-26\"><sup>26</sup></a>. La casa-studio della pittrice secentesca Elisabetta Sirani fungeva sia da spazio domestico e luogo di socializzazione con i committenti, sia da studio per la formazione di artisti. Gli inventari di questa bottega di famiglia elencano disegni, stampe e calchi in gesso di Dürer, Carracci e Michelangelo, mentre la piccola biblioteca ospitava libri di Ovidio e Ripa<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-27\"><sup>27</sup></a>: gli stessi artisti e autori documentati all’Accademia erano dunque utilizzati come risorse didattiche anche a Bologna. A Roma, gli interni di palazzi prestigiosi precorrevano il concetto di museo pubblico attirando talvolta anche visitatori esterni alle famiglie, inclusi allievi di arti visive<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-28\"><sup>28</sup></a> Oggetti scelti con cura e disposti in modo meticoloso possono creare gerarchie e trasmettere narrazioni che orientano e istruiscono l’osservatore. Come osservato da Gail Feigenbaum, la storia dell’arte veniva risolta sulle pareti delle case dei collezionisti romani, che promuovevano gli artisti esattamente come aveva fatto Vasari nelle pagine delle <em>Vite de’ più eccellenti pittori, scultori e architettori</em><a href=\"/endnotes/#note-29\"><sup>29</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>L’idea di esporre opere per favorire la formazione di un canone da parte di un’istituzione pedagogica mostra come l’Accademia di San Luca cercasse di definire l’educazione artistica in un campo largamente indefinito. Le pareti della scuola erano decorate come un palazzo romano e i ritratti creavano un’atmosfera formale e istituzionale all’interno di spazi modesti. Questa galleria di figure celebri traeva origine dalla consuetudine di esibire <em>illustrium imagines</em>. Gli antichi romani esponevano ritratti in ossequio agli antenati, una pratica successivamente rinnovata con una maggiore attenzione agli scritti di Petrarca, in particolare al <em>De viris illustribus</em><a href=\"/endnotes/#note-30\"><sup>30</sup></a>. Presentare delle biografie in una sequenza cronologica era stato il concetto chiave scelto da Vasari per organizzare le <em>Vite</em> nel 1550. Sotto la sua influenza, nello statuto dell’Accademia delle Arti del Disegno di Firenze approvato nel 1563 si era espressa la volontà di esporre opere d’arte in un fregio che documentasse tutti gli artisti eccellenti a cominciare da Cimabue. Nel 1568, Vasari aveva illustrato la seconda edizione delle <em>Vite</em> con le effigi degli artisti, ciascuna racchiusa in una cornice architettonica all’antica<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-31\"><sup>31</sup></a>. I ritratti dell’Accademia seguivano uno schema analogo, ancorché più sobrio, e Baglione, che modellò le sue <em>Vite</em> su quelle di Vasari, fa riferimento a molti di quei dipinti per documentarne l’esistenza e giustificare l’inclusione o esclusione di un artista nella sua raccolta di biografie.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"snalez"}],"length":2180,"title":"Il potenziale didattico delle collezioni e della biblioteca dell’Accademia","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/ParasolePortraitItalian/I_potenzialedidattico/"},{"content":"<p>Se a orientare le scelte in una collezione istituzionale sviluppata nell’arco di molti anni non è quasi mai una figura unica, stabilire chi dovesse apparire nella galleria dell’Accademia deve aver certamente generato un dibattito molto acceso durante le “adunanze” (riunioni) degli accademici. Gli autori della maggior parte di questi dipinti rimangono sconosciuti. Secondo Baglione, Antiveduto Gramatica eseguì il proprio ritratto, Orazio Borgiani eseguì quello di Tommaso Laureti e Ottavio Leoni quello di Tommaso Salini<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-32\"><sup>32</sup></a>. Un volume rilegato di disegni di Leoni conservato a Firenze contiene sei ritratti molto somiglianti a quelli elencati nell’inventario del 1633: essi rappresentano Annibale e Agostino Carracci, Caravaggio, Antonio Tempesta, Cristoforo Roncalli e Ludovico Leoni<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-33\"><sup>33</sup></a>. Da queste opere grafiche, Leoni incise dei ritratti datati tra il 1621 e il 1625, come ad esempio la stampa dal ritratto di Roncalli (fig. 4)<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-34\"><sup>34</sup></a>.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-4\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"An engraving shows a man from the bust up, gazing directly at the viewer.

Le iscrizioni sul verso delle effigi di Michelangelo, Dürer, Baccio Bandinelli, Adam Elsheimer e Jacopino del Conte indicano che Leoni le donò nel 1616<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-35\"><sup>35</sup></a>. L’effige di Leoni non era elencata nell’inventario del 1633, ma il suo figliastro, Ippolito Leoni, eseguì un ritratto di Ottavio che donò nello stesso anno, come riporta un’iscrizione sul verso<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-36\"><sup>36</sup></a>. Lo stesso Leoni, in qualità di neoeletto principe, aveva richiesto la compilazione dell’inventario del 1627 in cui erano elencati 58 ritratti, forse per avere contezza di chi fosse già incluso e chi potesse essere aggiunto. Sei anni dopo, furono contati undici ritratti in più, il che porta a ipotizzare che Leoni sia stato un elemento propulsore nell’ampliamento della collezione dell’Accademia<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-37\"><sup>37</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>I principi avevano un peso rilevante nel processo decisionale. Secondo quanto riporta Baglione, Ottavio Leoni disegnò, incise e dipinse un ritratto del padre Ludovico, che poi donò all’Accademia<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-38\"><sup>38</sup></a>. Le iscrizioni sul verso dei ritratti di Matthijs Bril e Bernardino Cesari documentano che i rispettivi fratelli, Paul Bril e Giuseppe Cesari, donarono quei dipinti nel 1622. Il ritratto di Luca Cambiaso, come afferma un’iscrizione sul verso, fu donato dall’allievo Bernardo Castello, il quale probabilmente utilizzò come modello un autoritratto che si trova agli Uffizi<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-39\"><sup>39</sup></a>. Comprendere come i propositi di alcuni di questi donatori abbiano favorito l’inclusione di figure per loro significative può forse aiutare a spiegare come Girolama Parasole – una donna che lavorava in ambito commerciale come illustratrice editoriale – sia entrata a far parte della collezione. Pur non avendo certamente l’influenza di un principe, Rosato e Bernardino Parasole potrebbero aver inciso sulla decisione di includere un membro della loro famiglia. Rosato, cognato di Girolama, compare come testimone in verbali di riunioni amministrative dell’Accademia, una per la nomina di un procuratore e un’altra per la ricezione di un pagamento. Bernardino, figlio di Girolama, era presente alla “congregazione” del 1624 in cui il principe ordinò un inventario della collezione<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-40\"><sup>40</sup></a>. Visti i contatti di Bernardino con Giuseppe Cesari e Cristoforo Roncalli, è verosimile che anche loro si siano espressi in favore dell’inclusione di Girolama. Inoltre, il fatto che molte delle incisioni e illustrazioni editoriali realizzate da lei e Leonardo fossero basate su immagini di Antonio Tempesta fa ipotizzare che anche quest’ultimo abbia potuto intercedere in suo favore<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-41\"><sup>41</sup></a>.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-left\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A painting shows a woman from the bust up, gazing directly at the viewer.

Il suo ritratto, tuttavia, si basava erroneamente sull’effige di una donna ignota: un’immagine, oggi conservata allo Château de Chantilly, che non ritraeva Anguissola ma che era stata eseguita da lei (fig. 6). La scelta erronea di questa donna riccamente vestita come modello per il ritratto dell’Accademia ci suggerisce come Anguissola fosse percepita dal copista da lei lontano, che si trovava a Roma. L’aspetto elegante della dama raffigurata si confà allo status di pittrice che Anguissola aveva alla corte del re Filippo II, tuttavia la rappresentazione sembra l’equivalente visivo della descrizione che Pietro Paolo de Ribera fa di lei nella biografia del 1609, quando racconta che era stata corteggiata da cavalieri spagnoli e italiani e che al pari di altre dame di corte aveva sfoggiato sfarzosi abiti in tessuti dorati, collane di perle e gemme preziose. Come ha osservato Julia Dabbs, i <em>topoi</em> regolarmente utilizzati dai biografi che scrivevano di artiste donne non erano privi di inaccuratezze e stereotipi.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-6\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-6\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A painting shows a woman from the bust up, gazing directly at the viewer.

Il ritratto dell’Accademia non assomiglia affatto ai molti autoritratti di Anguissola, nei quali la pittrice appare generalmente vestita in maniera sobria e pettinata con semplicità. Per contro, il volto ormai maturo di Girolama Parasole è raffigurato in modo realistico e non idealizzato: l’espressione della bocca, leggermente piegata da un lato, fa pensare che il ritratto sia stato eseguito da qualcuno che la conosceva personalmente, circostanza del tutto verosimile visto che l’incisora viveva in un quartiere popolato da artisti con cui lei e la sua famiglia avevano senz’altro contatti<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-43\"><sup>43</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>La presenza di Girolama Parasole nella galleria dell’Accademia colpisce perché il suo ruolo di intagliatrice di matrici per pubblicazioni commerciali non era certamente paragonabile a quello rivestito da una rinomata pittrice di corte, quale era Anguissola. La professione di quest’ultima, in effetti, era più in linea con gli ideali di decoro e rispetto verso l’arte che l’Accademia aveva promosso sin dalla sua fondazione nel 1593. Ad esempio, la vendita di immagini sacre o profane apposte in vetrina o altri luoghi pubblici era scoraggiata<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-44\"><sup>44</sup></a>. L’inclusione di questi ritratti di artiste, scomparse a tre anni di distanza l’una dall’altra, suggerisce una modalità di rappresentazione strettamente legata alle loro vicende biografiche, direttamente note ai membri dell’Accademia o percepite da una distanza letteraria o storica. Anguissola era stata valorizzata per il suo prestigio internazionale e Parasole per il suo riconoscimento a livello locale. I loro ritratti all’Accademia simboleggiano anche il riconoscimento delle donne come “accademiche di merito”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-45\"><sup>45</sup></a>, incluse tra i membri ma in numero decisamente inferiore rispetto agli uomini con una partecipazione attiva e incarichi di docenza. Dal 1607 le donne, come i forestieri, potevano fare domanda di ammissione, ma non avevano diritto di voto nella gestione della scuola<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-46\"><sup>46</sup></a>. Non è noto se durante la sua vita Girolama sia stata membro dell’Accademia. Il suo nome non risulta in nessun altro documento ma, in ogni caso, le sarebbe stato vietato di partecipare alle riunioni amministrative. Ciò rende la sua presenza nella collezione di ritratti dell’Accademia ancora più straordinaria: il suo ritratto fu esposto come segno della stima di cui godeva nella prima metà del Seicento.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"snalez"}],"length":1770,"title":"Curatori e donatori della collezione di ritratti","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/ParasolePortraitItalian/II_curatoriedonatori/"},{"content":"<p>Da questa breve indagine sulla collezione di ritratti dell’Accademia emerge una narrazione che evidenzia molteplici gerarchie. A dominare era una cultura che esaltava il genio, come dimostra l’inventario del 1633 in cui Michelangelo, Raffaello e Tiziano erano elencati per primi. L’aggiunta di familiari degli accademici promuoveva implicitamente il paradigma in base al quale padri e fratelli costituivano una prova delle capacità innate dei membri attivi – una forma di autopromozione da parte degli artisti, alcuni dei quali si adoperarono per far inserire il proprio ritratto più tardi. Se tuttavia il merito artistico era stato l’unico criterio di inclusione, allora andava valorizzata anche la missione di questa scuola d’arte, ossia quella di incoraggiare l’impegno e la diligenza nell’apprendimento di un mestiere – un ideale che il percorso professionale di Girolama Parasole incarnava a pieno titolo. Con tutta probabilità i suoi lavori non erano esposti nei palazzi romani come quelli di Caravaggio, ma la sua inclusione nella galleria di ritratti rifletteva la rilevanza dei suoi contributi in pubblicazioni che facilitavano la missione religiosa ed educativa dell’istituzione. Forse anche Cesare Ripa era stato incluso per una ragione simile: il suo libro di emblemi era utilizzato come fonte per comporre soggetti iconografici e allegorie tradizionali e nella biblioteca dell’Accademia ne erano conservate due copie. Prove documentali attestano in effetti che Leonardo Parasole era stato incaricato di intagliare le matrici per le immagini destinate alla seconda edizione dell’<em>Iconologia</em> di Ripa pubblicata nel 1603, che a differenza della prima (1593) era illustrata<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-47\"><sup>47</sup></a>.

La serie in 12 volumi era la risposta ufficiale alle <em>Centurie di Magdeburgo</em> protestanti<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-49\"><sup>49</sup></a>. Leonardo e Girolama mantennero stretti legami con la Congregazione dell’Oratorio di San Filippo Neri<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-50\"><sup>50</sup></a>. Per la tipografia degli Oratoriani, i Parasole realizzarono anche illustrazioni per il <em>De Ss. martyrum cruciatibus</em> (1594). In questa riedizione latina del <em>Trattato de gli instrumenti di martirio</em>, Girolama firma un’illustrazione raffigurante diversi tipi di supplizi della ruota basandosi sulle incisioni eseguite da Antonio Tempesta per l’edizione italiana (fig. 8)<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-51\"><sup>51</sup></a>. Il <em>De Ss. martyrum cruciatibus</em> diffondeva la venerazione dei testimoni cristiani delle origini in un linguaggio più universalmente comprensibile, ma potrebbe essere stato anche utilizzato come una sorta di manuale visivo per comporre immagini di santi martiri o un’enciclopedia delle morti per tortura, simile all’<em>Iconologia</em> di Ripa, ma dedicata a immagini sacre.</p>\n<p>Non ci sono prove che Girolama, o qualsiasi altra donna, abbia insegnato all’Accademia, ma forse gli accademici apprezzavano il suo apporto nel fornire risorse visive agli artisti. La missione educativa dell’istituzione rispecchiava gli obiettivi della Controriforma. Nell’<em>Origine et progresso dell’Academia</em> di Alberti si legge che Gabriele Paleotti e il cardinale Francesco Maria del Monte erano stati nominati “educatori della riforma” da papa Clemente VIII, il che significava che l’istituzione avrebbe seguito le riforme artistiche post-tridentine<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-52\"><sup>52</sup></a> Questa potrebbe essere un’altra ragione per cui gli accademici rispettavano il lavoro di Parasole, in linea con i più ampi valori dell’istituzione legati alla Chiesa e alla venerazione dei santi promossa da quest’ultima.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-8\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-8\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A page from a book shows several figures bound to a large wheel, some with visible spikes and others without.

La scoperta di molti nomi di artisti citati in fonti primarie è un importante contributo del progetto <em>The History of the Accademia di San Luca, c. 1590-1635</em>. Tra le possibili motivazioni dell’inclusione di Girolama Parasole tra i ritratti dell’Accademia, il riconoscimento del potenziale didattico dei suoi lavori e del rispetto che avrebbero ispirato agli osservatori può almeno in parte aiutarci a ricostruire le ragioni per cui i suoi contemporanei ritennero che meritasse un posto nella collezione. Non bisogna inoltre dimenticare che le donne della prima età moderna non sempre godevano di autonomia ed erano condizionate da vincoli sociali e giuridici. Nonostante tali restrizioni, un’artista donna scomparsa da poco venne inclusa in quel gruppo di illustri accademici di sesso maschile. Il messaggio veicolato da questo atto era di grande rilevanza: un’istituzione didattica nella Roma del primo Seicento promuoveva Girolama Parasole come artista “illustre” e di conseguenza degna di essere emulata.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"snalez"}],"length":1256,"title":"Il riconoscimento di Girolama Parasole nella prima età moderna","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/ParasolePortraitItalian/III_recoveryesteem/"},{"content":"<ol id=\"note-40\">\n<li id=\"note-1\">\n<p>Archivio di Stato (ASR), TNC, uff. 15, 1624, pt. 4, vol. 102, ff. 210r–v, 211r–v, 219r; ASR, TNC, uff. 15, 1627, pt. 3, vol. 113, ff. 27r–v, 28r–v, 41r–v; ASR, TNC, uff. 15, 1633, pt. 1, vol. 135, ff. 516r–v, 517r–v, 544r–v.

Her few signed prints, an anonymous portrait of her in the Accademia di San Luca, and a tiny amount of documentation of her everyday life, much of it inferential, can yield different and somewhat conflicting narratives. The questions we ask of her as a historical figure depend on the histories we wish to write.</p>\n<p>In an article on what she terms the “artist-function,” Caroline Jones describes the historian’s responsibility in producing a coherent authorial figure from known works of art along with “the effects of inscriptions, texts and talk” that remain after the death of an artist, noting how different individuals can emerge from historical analysis.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-2\"><sup>2</sup></a> Central to the question of the portrait of a particularly, perhaps purposefully, undistinguished-looking female artisan among the lace-collared, idealized, and perfectly posed likenesses of male academicians, is the question of who historians wish her to be. Chronologically, the first of these historians are the academicians who entered her portrait into the historical record of the Accademia. The second group is made up of historians who use that ostentatiously inclusive and disruptive act, as well as Girolama Parasole’s surviving artwork, to understand the formation of the arts, the development of printmaking as an art, and the participation of women in the arts through the opening that printmaking allowed. These two histories, we will see, might be at odds with each other.</p>\n<p>Since the beginning of the 16th century, the authorial responsibilities involved in creating printed images were designated separately. The person who invented the image was identified on prints by the word <em>invenit</em>, the person who copied the invention onto a printing matrix by <em>disegnavit</em>, and the person who engraved it into copper or wood by <em>sculpsit</em> or <em>incidit</em>. The attribution of skill in <em>disegno</em>, which had bearing on who was understood to be an artist, was dispersed among categories privileged by Giorgio Vasari and subsequently at both the Accademia delle Arti del Disegno in Florence and the Accademia di San Luca in Rome. Giovanni Baglione made a point of recognizing printmakers who were not necessarily inventors as practitioners of <em>disegno</em>. At the end of his <em>Vite de’ pittori, scultori et architetti</em> (1642), Baglione, who was <em>principe</em> of the Accademia di San Luca several times, added a short section on <em>intagliatori</em> that allowed someone who carved other artists’ inventions to be included in the Accademia’s conception of an artist.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-3\"><sup>3</sup></a></p>\n<p>The fact that he included the Parasole family among his <em>Vite</em> was unusual, given that they worked primarily in book illustration and, with two notable exceptions by Girolama, did not make single-sheet prints. Baglione begins by defending the inclusion of printmakers among the artists:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>good <em>intagliatori</em> in etching or engraving also understand <em>disegno</em>; and have a place among Painters, because with their sheets of paper they perpetuate the works of the most famous masters. And while their efforts sometimes fade in the public eye, they are admired, and one cannot deny that their sheets ennoble and enrich the Cities of the World. Also, some painters, in the end, have their works made into etchings or engravings, and as they were painters, they were also engravers. They can boast these virtues in common, and are equally praised.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-4\"><sup>4</sup></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>This supports Susan Nalezyty’s proposition that Girolama was important to the Accademia as a provider of printed images used as models for the students, who the academicians hoped to train in the style of the best masters.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-5\"><sup>5</sup></a> However, she was scarcely the most visible of the <em>intagliatori</em> that Baglione mentions; in fact, he does not mention her. What did she alone add to the gallery of academicians that, like Baglione’s <em>Vite</em>, self-consciously plotted a history of the development of the arts in Rome?</p>\n<p>By examining Parasole’s presence among the academicians through a close look at her known training, professional work, and associations, we place an unavoidably speculative notion of her ambitions and opportunities in a rapidly changing profession and social world into juxtaposition with conjecture about what the Accademia gained by writing into its history that particular portrait of a woman who carved images designed by others into woodblocks for printing.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Header image: Girolama Parasole after Antonio Tempesta</em>, Battle of the Lapiths and Centaurs, <em>n.d., woodblock print, The Art Institute of Chicago, The Amanda S.

The painter seems familiar with the particularities of her face, and the circumstances of her life. There is a sense of vulnerability in its lack of pretention; she looks unaware of being studied. A devout Oratorian and active member of that congregation since its inception, Girolama worked for most of her life with her husband, Leonardo Parasole (d. 1612), and other members of her family carving images into boxwood blocks to illustrate an astonishing range of books published in Rome around the turn of the 17th century.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-6\"><sup>6</sup></a></p>\n<figure id=\"fig-2-1\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2.1\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A painting shows a woman from the bust up, gazing directly at the viewer.

The Parasole family provided woodblock illustrations for prestigious publications on New World plants; images in canonical liturgical books that required republishing after the Council of Trent; hagiographies and descriptions of martyrdom; visualizations of arcane iconography; and images for books in Arabic for the Medici Oriental Press. Portraits of clerics and rulers and images of the city created more opportunities for the family. It is likely that Girolama worked with her husband, her sister-in-law Isabella Parasole, and her brother-in-law Rosato Parasole on model books of lace patterns, which would have been the most notably original works of <em>invention</em> from this second iteration of the busy family workshop.</p>\n<p>While Parasole is named and present in some surviving legal documents related to family matters and real estate that she owned in the city, her professional presence, and even her name, are confusing. In legal documents written in Latin, she appears as Hieronima Cagnaccia Parasole or a variation on that name. The monogram she used in the few cases where she signed woodcuts in illustrated books was “G.AP” with a tiny image of a woodcarver’s knife, a matching pendant to her husband’s monogram, “LP” with a knife. Her two large, undated, single-sheet prints are signed with her name in Latin, Hieronima Parasole. The cartouche at the bottom of her Accademia portrait, which may have been painted later than the portrait itself, gives her name in Italian along with the date and her profession: “Girolama Parasoli, Sc./1612.”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-7\"><sup>7</sup></a> We are looking at a portrayal of a sculptor in woodworking for the first time under her own name, as would be appropriate for widows.</p>\n<p>Attempting to characterize Girolama’s talent, skills, and even her oeuvre puts us on unstable terrain. She never claimed to design the prints we know she carved. Indeed she worked in the space between the world of invention, increasingly represented at the Accademia di San Luca, and the world of production and circulation that took place in the printshops and bookshops at the center of Rome. No contracts or agreements of association have yet been discovered that help us to understand the conduct of Girolama’s professional life, although documents regarding that of her husband and brother-in-law do exist.</p>\n<p>Women transacting business in Rome during this period required a <em>mundualdus</em> to enter into a contract. This male relative or family friend negotiated contractual terms and “provided a means of dealing with those potentially dysfunctional moments in the structure of male dominance when women entered the public arena.”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-8\"><sup>8</sup></a> For this reason, when trying to piece together the professional life of a Roman woman from this period, it is necessary to interpret sources in light of social and family relations to understand what was socially and legally probable. Surviving materials for this include a notarial document from the beginning of Girolama’s career as a carver of woodblocks to illustrate books, and Baglione’s entry in a canonical work of the literature of art published two decades after her death. Since they bookend a discussion of Girolama Parasole’s career and reputation, we could begin by reading them together.</p>\n<p>The document from the beginning of Girolama and Leonardo’s book-illustrating career frees Leonardo from association with a family workshop that practiced the “arte di zoccholi.”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-9\"><sup>9</sup></a> It was contracted in 1585 at the death of his father, who arrived in Rome from Sant’Angelo in Visso in Norcia around 1572, and established a workshop for carving wooden clogs in the printing district.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-10\"><sup>10</sup></a> The document releasing Leonardo from the family business shows that four Parasole sons worked together, each specializing in tasks necessary to run a shop that produced wooden shoes as well as small drums, tambourines, and small wooden caskets. While two brothers carved and would continue to carve the hardwood shoes, boxes, toys, and tambourines that were the shop’s mainstay, Rosato painted them with decorations and Leonardo carved woodblocks to print images that decorated them. The agreement shows that Leonardo had already begun working on his own, carving botanical images by an unknown designer for an herbal by the papal physician, Castore Durante.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-11\"><sup>11</sup></a> Leonardo’s wife is mentioned but not named in the document, which shows that her dowry had been invested in the running of the shop, as had the dowry of another brother’s deceased wife, and the couple was allowed to extract those funds from the family association along with the paper, blocks, and prints related to the herbal. From the beginning of their Roman residency, the model for the Parasoles’ social and economic life was the family workshop, in which both men and women of an extended family shared work and financial resources. It is important to conceptualize Girolama Parasole’s formation as a sculptor in that structure, where she contributed her skills as a woodblock carver to a diversified family enterprise.</p>\n<p>The second central, if convoluted, document is full of errors but sheds light on the arc of Girolama’s professional life and reputation: Baglione’s entry that included the Parasole family among biographies of noteworthy Roman artists.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"elincoln"}],"length":1203,"title":"The Portrait","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/ParasolePrintmaking/I_theportrait/"},{"content":"<p>We saw that the case for considering printmakers as artists rested on their expertise in <em>disegno</em>, and their role in making the works of the great(er) masters known to the wider world. Baglione draws painters and printmakers closer together by mentioning that some painters not only had their work made into prints, but perhaps made prints themselves. Although etchers and engravers in copper were the more prestigious printmakers, Baglione showed an unusual interest in woodblock cutting, providing an extended description of that craft in the life of the little-known Giovan Giorgio Nuvolstella. An active member of the Compagnia di San Giuseppe di Terrasanta from 1600 until his death in 1643, Baglione had personally associated with a wider variety of people involved with the arts—<em>battilori</em> (goldbeaters), <em>intagliatori</em> (engravers, carvers), <em>librari</em>  (book and print sellers), and <em>musici</em> (musicians)—than he would have encountered at meetings of the Accademia, where he was equally deeply engaged.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-12\"><sup>12</sup></a> The Compagnia admitted women as courtesy members, so he knew of the artist wives of other <em>confratelli</em>, although it is unclear if he ever met them. It is clear, however, that he did not know all the members of the Parasole family, none of whom appear in the confraternity’s rosters. He would have met Giovanni Battista Raimondi, the renowned Arabist who ran the Medici Oriental Press, with whom Leonardo worked closely in the last decades of his life.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-13\"><sup>13</sup></a> Raimondi, who was deeply mourned by the confratelli at his death, was a friend of Girolama and Leonardo as well as an employer, and stood as godfather at the baptism of their daughter in 1589.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-14\"><sup>14</sup></a> In a few short paragraphs, Baglione not only provided the single notice of the Parasole family in the early modern literature on art, but also scrambled their relationships to each other in a way that deeply misrepresented the character of their work, and their identities, for centuries to come.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-15\"><sup>15</sup></a> But this confusion is productive for understanding Girolama Parasole’s conception of her work.</p>\n<p>What can we learn about Girolama from Baglione’s account, in which he never mentions her? Toward the end of the previous <em>vita</em>, he tells us that some of Giovanni Maggi’s works had been made into woodblock prints by Paul Maupin, and probably knowing that Maupin and Leonardo Parasole had worked together, Baglione uses this as a bridge to the <em>Vita di Lionardo, Isabella, e Bernardino Parasoli</em>. These family members, whom he believes to be relevant to the progression of the arts of <em>intaglio</em>, are discussed as a group in his chapter on printmakers, even though Bernardino worked solely as a painter. Baglione writes: “Having mentioned wood carvings, I now present to memory Leonardo Parasole, Norcino, whose works were made in wood, who gained praise because in fact woodcutting is more dangerous and difficult than <em>intaglio</em> in copper.” He begins with the early herbal, noting that Durante had been the physician of Sixtus V. He says that Leonardo’s images were often supplied by Antonio Tempesta, including the pictures for the Arabic Gospels printed at the Medici Oriental Press, with special praise for its scholarly director Raimondi, the “grandissimo Letterato” who was so honored at his death by the artist’s confraternity. He writes that Leonardo’s son, Bernardino, had studied with the Cavalier d’Arpino, and while citing the frescoes he “colored with his own hand” in San Rocco, he can only say that he had died young, and “great things were hoped from him.”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-16\"><sup>16</sup></a></p>\n<p>In this brief notice, Baglione collapses the sisters-in-law Isabella and Girolama under the name of Isabella. The women were probably known to him only through hearsay, and only Isabella’s name had ever appeared in print. Isabella Catanea Parasole, whom he mistakenly takes to be Leonardo’s wife and mother of his youngest son Bernardino, was the second wife of Leonardo’s painter brother Rosato. She was one of many marriageable young women in danger of falling into prostitution who, under the modern initiatives of Catholic reform, had been rescued from that life and brought to the Augustinian convent of Santa Caterina dei Funari, where girls were taught needlework and provided with dowries.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-17\"><sup>17</sup></a> Rosato applied to the convent to marry Isabella in 1593, understanding the strength of the market for inventive ornamental patterns and the value of a well-educated, talented, industrious, and likely beautiful wife. Baglione seems to be completely unfamiliar with Leonardo’s actual wife. As Leonardo was the son of a shoemaker, Girolama was the daughter of a hatmaker, also originally from Visso.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-18\"><sup>18</sup></a> Rosato left the family workshop the year after Leonardo to work as a mosaicist and decorative painter.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-19\"><sup>19</sup></a> He earned a living in decorative wall painting, making ephemeral decorations for festivals and, from 1602, as a mosaicist for the interior dome of Saint Peter’s.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-20\"><sup>20</sup></a> Although Rosato participated in at least some of the meetings of the Accademia di San Luca, Baglione never mentions him. However, he was the motivating force behind the first gorgeously illustrated model book of lace designs, printed in intricate white geometric patterns against a black background, that carried the name of his wife Isabella as the author (fig. 2.2). Appearing in 1595, it bore the graceful title <em>Specchio delle Virtuose Donne</em>, printed “ad’istantia di Rosato Parasole.”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-21\"><sup>21</sup></a> Its long and appropriately courteous full-page dedication to the Duchess of Sermoneta shows that the new author was aware of the style and importance of the convention of placing a dedication at the beginning of a book.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-2-2\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2.2\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A black-and-white woodblock print on paper depicts a decorative motif resembling snowflakes arranged in two horizontal rows.

The Augustinian convent in which Isabella was taught specialized in training girls in the lucrative lace design that would make them useful to any artisanal family’s economy, but there is no reason to assume that they were taught how to carve hard and dense boxwood with intricate patterns, something Baglione makes a point of saying is dangerous and difficult. The tiny white triangles and circles that make up the lace patterns are cut away from the surface of the block with small, sharp blades. Baglione wrote in his <em>vita</em> of Nuvolstella:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>The part that is not needed is excised, and the other, which is used, which remains there like a bas-relief, shows the images and represents stories; and the instrument for doing  this is iron, which the Artisan handles to cut the work, and as he diminishes the material, the form grows, and the whole receives its perfection from the absence of these parts.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-22\"><sup>22</sup></a></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Baglione says that Nuvolstella assisted Isabella in carving botanical images for Federico Cesi when she had trouble completing them. We know that it was Girolama who carved the botanical images, but Baglione’s confusion helps us understand how intertwined the work of the two women would have been as they combined their skills to produce pattern books, explaining the invisibility of Girolama’s unsigned but essential contribution to the projects.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-2-3\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2.3\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A woodblock print on paper depicts the letters R, S, T, V, X, Y, and Z in white against a black background.

The pages, carved seven years before Isabella joined the family, were framed with twirling flourishes in imitation of tapering and swelling pen lines, and the white-on-black imagery developed for these pages continued to be a feature of Parasole print design. A picture begins to emerge of a family of woodblock carvers and decorators with connections to illustrated book printing, as well as to papal and aristocratic circles.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"elincoln"}],"length":1750,"title":"Baglione's Account","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/ParasolePrintmaking/II_baglioneaccount/"},{"content":"<p>Inventories of their property made upon the deaths of Leonardo (d. 1612) and Girolama (d. 1622) show that there was no printing press in their home, only a worktable for cutting woodblocks. They do not seem to have owned a studio or workshop apart from their house across from the Trevi Fountain. Throughout their professional lives, they worked as image providers for associates like the printer Fachetti and the Oratorian publisher Jacopo Tornieri. It would have been in keeping with the family’s conception of a workshop for the two sisters-in-law to have worked together during the years when both of them were raising their many children. Girolama could expertly carve intricate images for botanical illustration as well as swirling, narrowly cut calligraphic tendrils that could survive the printing press, while Isabella knew how to invent and draw lace designs that visually incorporated and deconstructed floral and vine-like imagery.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-24\"><sup>24</sup></a> Leonardo was an experienced advisor for creating printed model books and seeing publications through the maze of contracts, legal associations, finances, and official clearances they entailed, and Rosato’s experience as a decorative painter meant that he understood that patterns advertised for lace-making were equally useful to the work of wall painters, embroiderers, portrait painters, and even gardeners. The lively, courteous address in Isabella’s dedication to an actual or aspirational patron likely transcended the comportment of clog-makers and similar artisans, offering a window onto the education and social class of the convent’s wards and the patronage devout noblewomen practiced at religious houses for girls.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-25\"><sup>25</sup></a> In this way, Rosato’s marriage to Isabella doubled the number of talented women in the family, bringing new skills and manners to the woodcarvers and broadening their production in the model book sector.</p>\n<p>All of Isabella’s pattern books bore unadorned title pages except for the last one, <em>Teatro delle Nobili et Virtuose Donne</em> (1616), which featured an elaborate ornamental frontispiece engraved by academician and fellow printmaker Francesco Villamena. This is the work of hers that Baglione cited in his <em>vita</em>. As Leonardo is burnished by association with Antonio Tempesta, and Bernardino with Giuseppe Cesari, Isabella is linked with the skillful male woodcarver Giovan Giorgio Nuvolstella and the academician Francesco Villamena. The somewhat thin story of Parasole artistic accomplishment that emerges is strengthened by framing it in a garland of praiseworthy popes, significant physicians, renowned scholars, and major participants at the Accademia di San Luca.</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"fig-2-4\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2.4\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"A winged, god-like figure with a long beard is depicted at the center of the composition.

The instances of her signed work constitute a very short list. Three books include woodcut illustrations bearing her monogram:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>Dialoghi…intorno alle medaglie inscrittioni et altre antichità</em>, 1592.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-26\"><sup>26</sup></a> The book is illustrated throughout with unsigned images of coins, including the inscriptions, which are the subject of the book. Only four images are signed, bearing the monograms of Girolama (under an image of the Arch of Titus), Leonardo, and Paul Maupin. The monogrammed full-page woodcuts show inscription-bearing Roman arches in an urban setting. Unlike the images of coins, they demonstrate the use of perspective, shading and atmospheric effects, architectural ornament, and figures. No inventor for these images is named, although some are clearly copies of well-known prints by Nicolas Beatrizet and others.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>De SS. martyrvm crvciatibvs</em>, 1594. This is a smaller-format Latin version, with woodcuts designed by Giovanni Guerra, of an Italian volume illustrated with etchings by Antonio Tempesta of tortures and martyrdoms of Catholic saints.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-27\"><sup>27</sup></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Annales Ecclestiastici</em>, 1594. Most images in these volumes are of coins, as in Antonio Agustín’s dialogue, none of which are signed, but the publisher’s records show that Leonardo was paid a scudo apiece for images of coins during this period. He also received eight scudi in payment for a woodcut of Giove Pluvio, inspired by a famous scene on the column of Marcus Aurelius, that bears Girolama’s monogram.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-28\"><sup>28</sup></a> Although it could be assumed, this provides evidence that contracts for Girolama’s work were enacted in Leonardo’s name. <a href=\"/endnotes/#note-29\"><sup>29</sup></a> The image, small enough to have been cut from the boxwood that was a specialty of the family, differs completely from an earlier version of the same volume printed in 1590 that was deemed unsatisfactory (figs. 2.4–2.6). Capitalizing on her skill in cutting dramatic white forms snaking across dark backgrounds, Girolama emphasizes the thunder and lightning that accompany the god, whose miraculous appearance brings life-giving rain. She skillfully works chiaroscuro effects into the image so that there is a sense of depth in the shadow behind the god, from which soldiers and horses tumble to their deaths. In the foreground, a pathetic figure lifted from ancient Niobid or Amazonomachy reliefs, perhaps by way of printed battle scenes like Marco Dente’s, lies crumpled and foreshortened in the swirling water, his head resting against one bent arm (fig. 2.7).<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-30\"><sup>30</sup></a></p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<figure id=\"fig-2-7\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2.7\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"An engraving depicts a battle scene in a landscape with soldiers on horseback and several fallen men.

While there is no date on the image, the full signature most likely means that Girolama was working alone, after the death of her husband. As a widow in Rome, she could move freely among the protective community of male artists and writers who had provided images for her and her husband to carve, and who had stood as godfathers and employers to their children. Perhaps she had taken note of the high value of her work on the image of Giove Pluvio, and felt confident enough to try printmaking in a different milieu—that of the artist—which would have offered new opportunities for <em>intagliatori</em> who, it was argued, should be considered as practitioners of <em>disegno</em>.

In contrast, the disturbingly plain portrait of Girolama shows us a devout artisan operating in her own name as a widow, dutifully carrying on a family profession as many widows did in the book printing business. Girolama’s reputation as a committed Christian, her work for the Vatican physician, or for Cardinal Cesare Baronio, as well as her possible presence in the many unsigned woodcuts for liturgical volumes organized and published by her husband at the turn of the century, made her an unusual symbol of the good that printed images could do in the world that the church was fashioning with the help of the devout populace of Christendom after the Council of Trent.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-35\"><sup>35</sup></a> When portraits of women were included in series of <em>uomini illustri</em>, they were often presented as mythological or biblical characters, types as compared to the recognizable, time-bound men they accompanied. According to Gabriele Paleotti, who helpfully reminds us that it is important to distinguish between the act of making a portrait and the uses made of it afterward, portraits were supposed to portray “persons whose moral goodness or Christian sanctity may act as incentive to others to practice the virtues.”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-36\"><sup>36</sup></a> A variety of portraits allowed students to parse the possible forms of greatness an artist might embody. Girolama’s portrait certainly adds a dimension to the Accademia’s notions of artistic women, however narrowly it may represent the actual working life, or ultimately unknowable aspirations, of the particular woman.</p>\n<p>Baglione’s error points us to the community structures in which Girolama lived and worked, showing how anachronistic it is to assume that her portrait among the academicians meant that she took part in the art world in the same way as the academic artists with whom she actually worked closely: Antonio Tempesta, Francesco Villamena, Cristoforo Roncalli, and Giuseppe Cesari, for example, were particularly close to her and her family. A chronicle of her life and works, and of the few signed images that give us a sense of her partnership in a family workshop as well as her role in producing the picture atlas of early modern Roman intellectual life, cannot yield a coherent narrative about the Accademia’s portrait. Perhaps the most unusual aspect of the painted portrait of Girolama Parasole among those of the academicians is that it asks us to think more open-mindedly about the definition of, conduct of, and opportunities for printmakers in Rome during the period of Catholic reform, opportunities that the new Accademia found it helpful, up to a point, to embrace.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"elincoln"}],"length":743,"title":"Conclusions","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/ParasolePrintmaking/conclusions/"},{"content":"<ol>\n<li id=\"note-1\">\n<p>Caroline Jones, “The Artist-Function and Posthumous Art History,” <em>Art Journal</em> 76, no. 1 (Spring 2017): 144–145.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"note-2\">\n<p>Jones 2017, 145, discussing the perceived coherence of the “posthumous author-function” created by historians.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"note-3\">\n<p>Giovanni Baglione, <em>Le vite de’ pittori, scultori et architetti.

Le rare opere firmate di cui fu autrice, un suo ritratto anonimo presso l’Accademia di San Luca e un esiguo numero di documenti relativi alla sua vita quotidiana – che perlopiù non la riguardano direttamente – possono generare prospettive diverse e per certi versi contrastanti. Gli interrogativi che ci poniamo su di lei in quanto figura storica dipendono dalla narrazione che intendiamo costruire.</p>\n<p>In un articolo su ciò che definisce la “funzione-artista”, Caroline Jones descrive la responsabilità dello storico nel delineare una figura autoriale coerente sulla base di opere d’arte note e alla luce degli “effetti causati da iscrizioni, testi e discorsi” che restano dopo la scomparsa di un artista, osservando come l’analisi storica possa far emergere personalità diverse<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-2\"><sup>2</sup></a>. L’effigie di un’artigiana dall’aspetto particolarmente – e forse volutamente – anonimo tra i ritratti idealizzati e perfettamente studiati di accademici in gorgiera solleva la questione centrale dell’identità che gli storici vogliono attribuirle. I primi storici in ordine cronologico sono gli stessi accademici che inserirono il ritratto negli annali della loro istituzione; il secondo gruppo è invece formato da chi ha utilizzato quell’atto ostentatamente inclusivo e dirompente, insieme alle opere di Girolama Parasole giunte fino a noi, per comprendere il processo di formazione delle arti, lo sviluppo dell’incisione come forma artistica e l’opportunità di inserimento nel mondo dell’arte che essa ha offerto alle donne. Come vedremo, queste due narrazioni potrebbero essere in contrasto tra di loro.</p>\n<p>Dagli inizi del Cinquecento, le responsabilità autoriali nella creazione di immagini stampate venivano indicate in modo distinto. Chi ideava l’immagine era identificato sulle stampe con la parola <em>invenit</em>, chi la copiava su una matrice con <em>disegnavit</em>, e chi la incideva su rame o su legno con <em>sculpsit</em> o <em>incidit</em>. L’attribuzione della competenza nel disegno, determinante nel definire ciò che fosse un artista, venne distribuita tra diverse categorie privilegiate da Giorgio Vasari e, di conseguenza, riconosciute anche dall’Accademia delle Arti del Disegno a Firenze e dall’Accademia di San Luca a Roma. Giovanni Baglione si adoperò per riconoscere agli incisori, che non erano necessariamente inventori, lo status di professionisti del disegno. In conclusione delle <em>Vite de’ pittori, scultori et architetti</em> (1642), il più volte principe dell’Accademia di San Luca aggiunse una breve sezione sugli “intagliatori” che consentiva a chi incideva invenzioni altrui di essere compreso nella concezione accademica di artista<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-3\"><sup>3</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>La sua scelta di inserire la famiglia Parasole nelle <em>Vite</em> appare singolare, dal momento che si dedicavano principalmente all’illustrazione libraria e non realizzavano stampe a foglio singolo, tranne che per due notevoli eccezioni per mano di Girolama. Baglione comincia col difendere l’inclusione degli incisori tra gli artisti:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Sogliono, ò Signor mio, esser’anche intendenti di disegno i buoni Intagliatori d’acqua forte, o di bulino; e però tra Dipintori possono havere il luogo; poiche con le loro carte fanno perpetue l’opere de’ piu famosi maestri: e benche le fatiche loro al cospetto del publico non sempre sieno stabilie, e si mirino, pure non si può negare, che li lor fogli non nobilitino, &amp; arrichiscano le Città del Mondo. Anzi alcuni Artefici di Pittura, in fin essi hanno d’acqua forte, o di bulino le proprie opere intagliare, e come erano Pittori, così anche Intagliatori furono; &amp; in loro queste Virtù hebbero commune il vanto, &amp; indistinta la lode<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-4\"><sup>4</sup></a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Ciò avvalora la tesi di Susan Nalezyty, secondo cui Girolama era importante per l’Accademia poiché forniva incisioni utilizzate come modelli dagli studenti, che gli accademici speravano di formare nello stile dei migliori maestri<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-5\"><sup>5</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>Girolama, tuttavia, non era certo la più in vista tra gli incisori citati da Baglione – anzi, egli non la cita affatto. Qual era allora il suo apporto specifico nella galleria degli accademici che, al pari delle <em>Vite</em> di Baglione, tracciava intenzionalmente una storia dello sviluppo delle arti a Roma?</p>\n<p>Esaminando la presenza di Girolama Parasole tra gli accademici alla luce di ciò che sappiamo della sua formazione, della sua attività professionale e delle sue relazioni, si pone a confronto un’idea inevitabilmente teorica speculativa circa le sue ambizioni e opportunità in un contesto sociale e professionale in rapida evoluzione, con l’ipotetico vantaggio che l’Accademia poteva trarre dall’inserire nella propria storia quel particolare ritratto di una donna che intagliava le matrici di legno con immagini create da altri e destinate alla stampa.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><em>Immagine di copertina: Girolama Parasole dopo Antonio Tempesta</em>, Battaglia tra Lapiti e Centauri, <em>n.d., incisione, The Art Institute of Chicago, The Amanda S.

La famiglia Parasole forniva illustrazioni xilografiche per prestigiose pubblicazioni sulle piante del Nuovo Mondo e libri liturgici canonici che dopo il Concilio di Trento dovevano essere ripubblicati, agiografie e descrizioni di martiri, rappresentazioni di iconografie arcane e immagini per testi in arabo commissionati dalla Tipografia Medicea Orientale. Ritratti di ecclesiastici e governanti e vedute della città fornivano alla famiglia ulteriori opportunità di guadagno. Probabilmente Girolama collaborò con il marito e i cognati Isabella e Rosato Parasole alla realizzazione di modellari di merletti, le opere d’invenzione più originali di questa seconda attività dell’operosa bottega familiare.</p>\n<p>Mentre Girolama Parasole è citata e presente in alcuni atti giuridici sopravvissuti riguardanti questioni familiari e immobili di sua proprietà a Roma, la sua attività professionale e persino il suo nome risultano confusi. Nei documenti legali redatti in latino è indicata come Hieronima Cagnaccia Parasole o con varianti di tale nome. Nei rari casi in cui firma le xilografie dei libri illustrati utilizza il monogramma “G.AP” seguito dal disegno di un piccolo stilo, <em>en pendant</em> con il monogramma del marito, “LP” con stilo. Le due grandi stampe a foglio singolo non datate che le sono attribuite sono firmate con il suo nome latino, Hieronima Parasole. Il cartiglio posto in basso nel ritratto dell’Accademia, forse aggiunto in un secondo momento, riporta invece il suo nome in italiano insieme alla data e alla professione: “Girolama Parasoli, Sc. 1612”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-7\"><sup>7</sup></a>: siamo di fronte all’effigie di una scultrice del legno identificata per la prima volta con il proprio nome, com’era consentito alle vedove.</p>\n<p>Tentare di definire il talento, le competenze e persino l’opera di Girolama ci pone su un terreno scivoloso. Lei stessa non si attribuì mai l’ideazione delle stampe che noi sappiamo aveva inciso. In realtà, si muoveva in uno spazio a metà tra il mondo dell’invenzione artistica, sempre più rappresentato all’Accademia di San Luca, e l’attività di produzione e diffusione che si svolgeva nelle tipografie e nelle librerie al centro di Roma. Non sono stati ancora scoperti contratti o accordi di collaborazione che possano aiutarci a capire lo svolgimento della sua vita professionale, ma esistono documenti riguardanti quella di suo marito e suo cognato.</p>\n<p>Le donne che svolgevano attività commerciali a Roma in questo periodo necessitavano di un <em>mundualdus</em> per poter stipulare un accordo. Questo parente maschio o amico di famiglia negoziava i termini contrattuali e “forniva uno strumento per affrontare quei momenti potenzialmente fuori norma nella struttura del predominio maschile in cui le donne accedevano alla sfera pubblica”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-8\"><sup>8</sup></a>. Ecco perché, quando si cerca di ricostruire la vita professionale di una donna romana in quest’epoca, è indispensabile interpretare le fonti alla luce delle relazioni sociali e familiari per poter comprendere ciò che era socialmente e legalmente plausibile. I documenti sopravvissuti utili a tale scopo includono un atto notarile risalente agli esordi della carriera di Girolama come intagliatrice di matrici in legno per illustrare libri e la voce inserita da Baglione in un caposaldo della letteratura artistica pubblicato a due decenni di distanza dalla sua morte. Poiché essi delimitano i confini di una discussione sulla carriera e la reputazione di Girolama Parasole, si potrebbe partire da una loro lettura.</p>\n<p>L’atto che segna l’inizio della carriera di Girolama e Leonardo Parasole come illustratori editoriali svincola quest’ultimo dall’associazione con la bottega di famiglia che praticava “l’arte di zoccholi”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-9\"><sup>9</sup></a>. Fu stipulato nel 1585, alla morte del padre, che era arrivato a Roma da Sant’Angelo di Visso, vicino Norcia, intorno al 1572 e aveva aperto una bottega di zoccoli in legno nel quartiere delle tipografie<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-10\"><sup>10</sup></a>. Il documento mostra che quattro figli Parasole lavoravano insieme e ognuno era specializzato nelle mansioni necessarie alla gestione di una bottega che produceva non solo calzature in legno ma anche piccoli tamburi, tamburelli e cofanetti in legno. Mentre due fratelli intagliavano – e avrebbero continuato a farlo – questi oggetti, che erano il punto di forza della bottega, Rosato li dipingeva e Leonardo incideva matrici lignee per stampare le immagini usate per decorarli. Come si legge nell’accordo, Leonardo aveva già iniziato a lavorare in proprio incidendo immagini botaniche disegnate da un artista ignoto per un erbario commissionato dal medico papale Castore Durante<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-11\"><sup>11</sup></a>. Nel documento la moglie di Leonardo è menzionata ma non nominata, il che attesta che la sua dote era stata investita nella gestione della bottega, com’era già avvenuto con quella della defunta moglie di un altro fratello, e che la coppia era autorizzata a scorporare questi fondi dalla società familiare insieme alla carta, alle matrici e alle stampe relative all’erbario. Fin dall’inizio della loro permanenza a Roma, il modello sociale ed economico dei Parasole fu la bottega familiare, in cui uomini e donne di un nucleo allargato lavoravano insieme e mettevano in comune le risorse finanziarie. È essenziale inquadrare la formazione di Girolama Parasole come <em>sculptor</em> all’interno di questa struttura, alla quale contribuiva con le sue competenze di intagliatrice di matrici lignee a servizio di un’impresa familiare diversificata.</p>\n<p>Il secondo documento chiave, ancorché contorto e pieno di inesattezze, fa luce sull’arco della vita professionale e della reputazione di Girolama: si tratta della voce di Baglione che includeva la famiglia Parasole tra le biografie degli artisti romani degni di nota.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"elincoln"}],"length":1248,"title":"Il ritratto","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/ParasolePrintmakingItalian/I_ritratto/"},{"content":"<p>Il riconoscimento degli incisori come artisti si basava – lo abbiamo visto poc’anzi – sulla competenza nel disegno e sul ruolo svolto nel far conoscere le opere dei grandi maestri al resto del mondo. Baglione avvicina i pittori agli incisori ricordando che alcuni pittori non solo facevano stampare le proprie opere, ma forse praticavano a loro volta l’incisione. Benché acquafortisti e intagliatori in rame godessero di maggiore prestigio tra gli incisori, Baglione mostra un insolito interesse per l’incisione xilografica, tecnica di cui fornisce una descrizione particolareggiata nella vita dello scarsamente noto Giovan Giorgio Nuvolstella. L’appartenenza alla Compagnia di San Giuseppe di Terrasanta, di cui è membro attivo dal 1600 fino alla morte (1643), consente a Baglione di entrare in contatto con un’ampia gamma di figure legate alle arti – battilori, intagliatori, librari e musici –, offrendogli più possibilità di incontro di quante non ne avrebbe avute partecipando alle “congregazioni” dell’Accademia, dove il suo impegno non era meno intenso<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-12\"><sup>12</sup></a>. Poiché la Compagnia ammetteva le donne tra i suoi membri, anche se non a pieno titolo, Baglione sapeva delle mogli artiste dei confratelli, benché non sia chiaro se le abbia mai incontrate di persona. Di certo non conosceva tutti i membri della famiglia Parasole, nessuno dei quali appare negli elenchi della confraternita. Avrebbe invece conosciuto Giovanni Battista Raimondi, il celebre arabista e direttore della Tipografia Medicea Orientale, con cui Leonardo Parasole collaborò da vicino negli ultimi decenni della sua vita<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-13\"><sup>13</sup></a>. Raimondi, la cui scomparsa avrebbe suscitato profondo cordoglio tra i confratelli, fu amico oltre che datore di lavoro di Girolama e Leonardo, di cui tenne a battesimo la figlia nel 1589<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-14\"><sup>14</sup></a>. n pochi brevi paragrafi, Baglione non solo offre l’unica notizia dei Parasole nella letteratura artistica della prima età moderna, ma fraintende i rapporti reciproci dei membri della famiglia in modo da confondere profondamente la natura della loro attività, e le loro identità, per i secoli a venire<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-15\"><sup>15</sup></a>. Questo fraintendimento può tuttavia tornare utile per comprendere la concezione che Girolama Parasole aveva del proprio lavoro.</p>\n<p>Che cosa può svelarci il resoconto di Baglione su Girolama, che peraltro non viene mai nominata? Verso la fine della biografia precedente nelle <em>Vite</em>, l’autore ci dice che alcune opere di Giovanni Maggi erano state riprodotte in xilografia da Paul Maupin, e poiché probabilmente sapeva che quest’ultimo aveva collaborato con Leonardo Parasole, usa tale collegamento per passare alla <em>Vita di Lionardo, Isabella e Bernardino Parasoli</em>. Questi congiunti, che Baglione ritiene rilevanti per l’evoluzione dell’arte dell’intaglio, sono trattati in gruppo nel capitolo sugli intagliatori, sebbene Bernardino praticasse solo la pittura. Scrive Baglione: “Con l’occasione, che abbiamo nominati gli intagli di legno, alla memoria ora mi si rappresenta Lionardo Parasole Norcino, il quale in legno le sue opere formava, ed acquistonne lode, per essere in ragione di taglio più difficile, e più pericoloso quello del legno, che del rame”. Il biografo prende le mosse dall’erbario di Durante, sottolineando come quest’ultimo fosse stato il medico di Sisto V. Riferisce che le immagini su cui Leonardo lavorava erano spesso fornite da Antonio Tempesta, comprese quelle per i vangeli in arabo stampati presso la Tipografia Medicea Orientale, e riserva un encomio speciale al suo direttore scientifico Raimondi, “grandissimo letterato” a cui la confraternita dell’artista tributò grandi onori in occasione della sua scomparsa. Scrive anche che il figlio di Leonardo, Bernardino, era stato allievo del cavalier d’Arpino e, menzionando gli affreschi che “colorì di sua mano” nella chiesa di San Rocco, poté solo dire che era morto giovane e che “da lui lavori degni di lode si speravano”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-16\"><sup>16</sup></a>.</p>\n<p>In questa breve nota Baglione, che probabilmente aveva solo sentito parlare delle cognate Isabella e Girolama, sovrappone le due figure sotto il nome della prima, il solo a essere mai apparso a stampa. Isabella Catanea Parasole, erroneamente identificata dal biografo con la moglie di Leonardo e la madre del suo figlio minore Bernardino, era in realtà la seconda moglie di Rosato, il fratello pittore di Leonardo. Era una delle tante giovani da marito a rischio di finire nella prostituzione che, grazie alle moderne iniziative della riforma cattolica, erano state sottratte a quella vita e accolte nel convento agostiniano di Santa Caterina dei Funari, dove imparavano a ricamare e ricevevano una dote<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-17\"><sup>17</sup></a>. Rosato fece richiesta al convento di sposare Isabella nel 1593, consapevole della forte domanda di modelli ornamentali originali da parte del mercato e del valore di una moglie istruita, dotata e operosa, nonché – probabilmente – anche di bella presenza. Baglione sembra non sapere nulla della vera moglie di Leonardo. Come lui, anche Girolama era figlia di un artigiano (cappellaio), a sua volta originario di Visso<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-18\"><sup>18</sup></a>. Rosato abbandonò l’attività familiare a distanza di un anno da Leonardo per lavorare come mosaicista e pittore decorativo<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-19\"><sup>19</sup></a>. Si guadagnava da vivere eseguendo pitture murali, apparati effimeri per feste e, a partire dal 1602, mosaici per la cupola interna di San Pietro<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-20\"><sup>20</sup></a>. Sebbene avesse partecipato quantomeno ad alcune delle congregazioni dell’Accademia di San Luca, Baglione non lo nomina mai. Eppure era stato proprio lui il promotore del primo modellario di merletti splendidamente illustrato, con intricati motivi geometrici in bianco su fondo nero e che riportano il nome della moglie Isabella come autrice (fig. 2.2). Apparso nel 1595, il volume recava l’elegante titolo <em>Specchio delle virtuose donne</em> ed era stampato “ad’istantia di Rosato Parasole”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-21\"><sup>21</sup></a>. La lunga dedica a tutta pagina rivolta alla duchessa di Sermoneta in tono appropriatamente cortese mostra come la nuova autrice fosse ben consapevole dello stile e dell’importanza di collocare la dedica in apertura del libro secondo la consuetudine.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-2-2it\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2.2it\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Stampa in bianco e nero su carta, realizzata con matrice in legno, che raffigura un motivo decorativo simile a fiocchi di neve stilizzati disposti in due file orizzontali.

Il convento agostiniano dove Isabella era stata istruita era specializzato nell’insegnare a disegnare merletti, un’attività remunerativa che avrebbe reso le ragazze formate una risorsa preziosa per l’economia di qualsiasi famiglia artigiana. Non vi è tuttavia motivo di supporre che si insegnasse anche a incidere intricati motivi nel legno di bosso, noto per la sua durezza e densità: lo stesso Baglione definisce quell’arte pericolosa e difficile, perché i piccoli triangoli e cerchietti bianchi che compongono i disegni dei merletti dovevano essere asportati dalla superficie della matrice lignea con coltellini affilati. Scrive il biografo nella <em>vita</em> di Nuvolstella:</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Et hora l’età nostra mirasi ne’ legni figurar gl’intagli delle sue opere. Cava è la parte, che non serve; e l’altra, che serve, restandovi a guisa di basso rilievo, mostra l’imagini, e rappresenta l’historie; e lo stromento a ciò fare è un ferro, che dall’Artefice maneggiato co’l taglio opera, e mentre sminuisce la materia, cresce la forma, e dal mancamento delle parti riceve la perfettione il tutto<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-22\"><sup>22</sup></a>.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Baglione riferisce che Nuvolstella aiutava Isabella nell’intaglio di immagini botaniche per Federico Cesi quando lei non riusciva a completarle. Noi sappiamo che era Girolama a intagliare quelle immagini, ma la confusione di Baglione ci aiuta a comprendere da un lato quanto stretta fosse la collaborazione tra le due donne che univano le rispettive competenze per produrre modellari, e dall’altro l’invisibilità del contributo anonimo eppure fondamentale di Girolama ai progetti.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-2-3it\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image is-pulled-right\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2.3it\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Stampa su carta realizzata con matrice in legno, che raffigura le lettere R, S, T, V, X, Y e Z in bianco su sfondo nero.

È del tutto verosimile che sia stata proprio la dedica di Curione al cardinale d’Este a ispirare quella nel modellario di Isabella, pubblicato a distanza di quasi un decennio. Fatto insolito per un volume di calligrafia a stampa, alcune lettere erano rese in bianco su fondo nero (fig. 2.3). Le pagine, incise sette anni prima che Isabella entrasse a far parte della famiglia, erano incorniciate da svolazzanti ghirigori a imitazione dei tratti di penna spessi e sottili, e le immagini bianche su sfondo nero elaborate per queste stampe divennero una caratteristica distintiva dello stile incisorio dei Parasole. Inizia così a delinearsi il quadro di una famiglia di intagliatori e decoratori di matrici lignee con aderenze nel mondo dell’editoria illustrata e negli ambienti papali e aristocratici.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"elincoln"}],"length":1820,"title":"I Parasole nelle *Vite* di Baglione","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/ParasolePrintmakingItalian/II_parasolebaglione/"},{"content":"<p>Dagli inventari dei beni redatti alla morte di Leonardo (1612) e Girolama (1622) risulta che nella loro abitazione non avevano un torchio da stampa, ma solo un tavolo da lavoro per intagliare le matrici in legno. A quanto pare non possedevano uno studio o un laboratorio separati dalla casa davanti alla Fontana di Trevi. In tutta la loro vita professionale, lavorarono per fornire immagini a clienti come il tipografo Fachetti e l’editore oratoriano Jacopo Tornieri. Che le due cognate lavorassero insieme negli anni in cui erano entrambe impegnate a crescere la numerosa prole era in linea con la concezione di bottega che si aveva in famiglia. Girolama era esperta nell’intagliare immagini complesse per illustrazioni botaniche e ornamenti calligrafici dalle linee sinuose e sottili capaci di sopravvivere al torchio, mentre Isabella sapeva inventare e disegnare merletti che incorporavano e scomponevano visivamente elementi floreali e viticci<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-24\"><sup>24</sup></a>. Leonardo era bravo nel creare modellari a stampa e nel seguire le pubblicazioni districandosi tra contratti, associazioni legali, questioni finanziarie e autorizzazioni ufficiali. Quanto a Rosato, l’esperienza come pittore decorativo gli dava modo di comprendere che i motivi proposti per la produzione di merletti potevano servire anche a pittori murali, ricamatori, ritrattisti e persino giardinieri. I toni vivaci e cortesi usati da Isabella nella dedica a una mecenate reale o aspirante tale probabilmente andavano oltre i comportamenti di zoccolai e artigiani simili, aprendo una finestra sul grado di istruzione e la classe sociale delle giovani educate in convento e sul mecenatismo praticato da devote nobildonne negli istituti religiosi femminili<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-25\"><sup>25</sup></a>. Il matrimonio di Rosato con Isabella raddoppiò dunque il numero di donne di talento in famiglia, apportando nuove competenze e <em>savoir faire</em> e ampliando le possibilità di produzione nel settore dei modellari.</p>\n<p>Tutti i modellari di Isabella avevano copertine disadorne, ad eccezione dell’ultimo, <em>Teatro delle nobili et virtuose donne</em> (1616), che presentava un elaborato frontespizio ornamentale realizzato dall’accademico e incisore Francesco Villamena. È questa l’opera di Isabella che Baglione cita nella sua biografia. Così come il legame con Antonio Tempesta dava lustro a Leonardo e quello con Giuseppe Cesari a Bernardino, Isabella è associata all’abile intagliatore Giovan Giorgio Nuvolstella e all’accademico Francesco Villamena. La storia in qualche modo scarna dei successi artistici dei Parasole viene così rafforzata dalla ghirlanda di papi benemeriti, medici illustri, insigni studiosi e membri di spicco dell’Accademia di San Luca che le fanno da cornice.</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"fig-2-4it\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column

</figure>\n<p>Abbiamo inserito la descrizione della carriera di Girolama e della sua fama – per come appare – tra due fonti primarie, nessuna delle quali in realtà la cita. Gli esempi di opere firmate da lei sono estremamente rari. Tre libri includono illustrazioni xilografiche con il suo monogramma:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>Dialoghi…intorno alle medaglie inscrittioni et altre antichità</em>, 1592.<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-26\"><sup>26</sup></a> Il libro è interamente illustrato con immagini di medaglie non firmate, come quelle delle iscrizioni che sono l’oggetto del libro. Solo quattro immagini recano i monogrammi di Girolama (sotto un’immagine dell’arco di Tito), Leonardo e Paul Maupin. Le xilografie monogrammate a tutta pagina rappresentano archi romani con iscrizioni in un contesto urbano. A differenza delle immagini di medaglie, mostrano l’uso della prospettiva, ombreggiature ed effetti atmosferici, ornamenti architettonici e figure. Per queste immagini non è riportato il nome di un inventore, anche se alcune sono chiaramente copie di celebri stampe di Nicolas Béatrizet e altri.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>De SS. martyrvm crvciatibvs</em>, 1594. Si tratta di una versione latina in formato ridotto, con xilografie disegnate da Giovanni Guerra, di un volume italiano illustrato con acqueforti di Antonio Tempesta raffiguranti torture e martiri di santi cattolici<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-27\"><sup>27</sup></a>.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Annales Ecclestiastici</em>, 1594. Come nel dialogo di Antonio Agustín, gran parte delle immagini illustrate in questi volumi raffigurano medaglie, nessuna delle quali è firmata. Dai registri dell’editore risulta tuttavia che in questo periodo Leonardo fu pagato uno scudo per ogni immagine di medaglia e in più ricevette otto scudi per un’incisione su legno di Giove Pluvio, ispirata a una famosa scena della colonna di Marco Aurelio, recante il monogramma di Girolama<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-28\"><sup>28</sup></a>. Questo dimostra, al di là delle ipotesi, che i contratti per i lavori dell’artista erano stipulati a nome di Leonardo<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-29\"><sup>29</sup></a>. L’immagine, sufficientemente piccola da essere incisa su legno di bosso – attività in cui la famiglia era specializzata – si distingue nettamente da una versione precedente dello stesso volume stampata nel 1590 e ritenuta insoddisfacente (figg. 2.4-2.6). Sfruttando al meglio la sua abilità nell’incidere suggestive forme bianche serpeggianti su sfondi scuri, Girolama enfatizza i tuoni e i lampi che accompagnano il dio, la cui miracolosa apparizione porta pioggia vivificante. Lavora abilmente sugli effetti del chiaroscuro nell’immagine conferendo profondità all’ombra dietro alle spalle del dio, dalla quale soldati e cavalli precipitano verso la morte. In primo piano, una figura patetica vista di scorcio – forse ispirata ad antichi rilievi di niobidi o amazzonomachie, forse a incisioni di scene di battaglia come quelle di Marco Dente – giace accasciata in un vortice d’acqua, la testa appoggiata al braccio piegato (fig. 2.7)<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-30\"><sup>30</sup></a>.</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<figure id=\"fig-2-7it\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2.7it\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"Scena di battaglia in un paesaggio, con soldati a cavallo e diversi uomini a terra, mentre un altro gruppo di cavalieri appare sullo sfondo dell'incisione.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/fig7-dente-battle-scene.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2.7it\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 2.7</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Marco Dente da Raffaello, <em>Scena di battaglia in un paesaggio con soldati a cavallo, diversi uomini caduti e un altro gruppo di cavalieri sullo sfondo</em>, c. 1520, incisione,</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Elisha Whittelsey Collection, The Elisha Whittelsey Fund, 1959, 59.570.277</span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"Scena di battaglia in un paesaggio, con soldati a cavallo e diversi uomini a terra, mentre un altro gruppo di cavalieri appare sullo sfondo dell'incisione.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/fig7-dente-battle-scene.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2.7it\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 2.7</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Marco Dente da Raffaello, <em>Scena di battaglia in un paesaggio con soldati a cavallo, diversi uomini caduti e un altro gruppo di cavalieri sullo sfondo</em>, c. 1520, incisione,</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">The Metropolitan Museum of Art, The Elisha Whittelsey Collection, The Elisha Whittelsey Fund, 1959, 59.570.277</span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>In ultimo, due grandi e ambiziose xilografie narrative a foglio singolo senza data costituiscono forse il tassello più importante per comprendere il possibile significato della pratica di Girolama in relazione al ritratto dell’Accademia. Queste incisioni popolate di figure, una di soggetto biblico e una di tema mitologico, sono entrambe realizzate a partire da disegni di Antonio Tempesta e recano la firma completa di Girolama anziché un semplice monogramma:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>The Last Judgment</em>, at lower left: HIER[onim].A P[arasol].E INC[idit]. /A[ntonio]TE[mpesta] (fig. 2.8).<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-31\"><sup>31</sup></a></p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Battaglia tra Lapiti e Centauri</em>, in basso al centro: HIERONIMA PARASOLIA INCID.; in basso a sinistra: ANTO.

Le loro dimensioni sono leggermente inferiori a quelle di un foglio imperiale e, benché i rari esemplari di entrambe giunti fino a noi siano ritagliati vicino all’immagine, è possibile notare che in origine erano circondati da un bordo nero<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-33\"><sup>33</sup></a>. Il formato della <em>Battaglia tra Lapiti e Centauri</em> può aver influito in parte sulla forza espressiva dell’esecuzione, di cui è difficile cogliere appieno l’effetto per via della distribuzione irregolare dell’inchiostro su una superficie così ampia. La drammatica scena di battaglia rappresenta soldati a cavallo e centauri che brandiscono spade; in basso al centro, al di sopra di un cartiglio che proclama la versione latina del nome di Girolama, un centauro sconfitto giace accasciato al suolo, la testa affondata nel braccio piegato. La mischia di uomini e cavalli è un tratto distintivo di Tempesta, di cui Girolama iscrive orgogliosamente il nome come inventore dell’immagine sulla fibbia di uno scudo in primo piano a destra.</p>\n<figure id=\"fig-2-9it\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2.9it\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"In questa incisione viene rappresentata una scena di battaglia con soldati a cavallo che occupano gran parte della composizione e diversi uomini a terra.\" class=\"q-figure__image\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/fig9-lapiths-centaurs.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__label q-figure__label--below\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2.9it\"><span class=\"q-figure__label-icon\"><svg data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">   <switch>     <use xlink:href=\"#fullscreen-icon\"></use>   </switch> </svg> <span class=\"visually-hidden\" data-outputs-exclude=\"epub,pdf\">Expand</span> </span><span class=\"q-figure__label-text\">Figure 2.9</span></a> </span> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\">Girolama Parasole da Antonio Tempesta, <em>Battaglia tra Lapiti e Centauri</em>, s.d., incisione,</span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\">The Art Institute of Chicago, The Amanda S.

Sebbene l’immagine non sia datata, la firma completa suggerisce che Girolama l’abbia realizzata da sola, dopo la morte del marito. Lo stato vedovile le dava la possibilità di muoversi liberamente a Roma, protetta dalla comunità di artisti e scrittori che in passato avevano fornito a lei e al marito immagini da incidere ed erano stati padrini e datori di lavoro dei loro figli. Forse Girolama aveva preso atto dell’alto pregio del suo lavoro sull’immagine di Giove Pluvio e si sentiva abbastanza sicura da provare l’incisione in un contesto diverso – quello dell’artista –, il che avrebbe offerto nuove opportunità agli intagliatori, che come si andava affermando, venivano considerati professionisti del disegno. Il necrologio nei registri parrocchiali la indica curiosamente come “scultrice e pittrice”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-34\"><sup>34</sup></a>.

Il ritratto fastidiosamente modesto di Girolama ci mostra invece una devota artigiana che in quanto vedova opera con il proprio nome, portando diligentemente avanti il mestiere di famiglia come facevano molte altre donne nella sua condizione nel settore della stampa editoriale.</p>\n<p>La sua fama di fervente cristiana, l’attività svolta per il medico vaticano o per il cardinale Cesare Baronio, così come la sua possibile mano nelle tante xilografie senza firma per volumi liturgici assemblati e pubblicati dal marito a cavallo del secolo, facevano di lei un originale simbolo del bene che le immagini stampate erano in grado di produrre nel mondo che la chiesa cattolica andava plasmando con l’aiuto del popolo dei fedeli dopo il Concilio di Trento<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-35\"><sup>35</sup></a>. Quando si includevano ritratti femminili nelle serie di “uomini illustri”, le donne erano spesso raffigurate come figure mitologiche o bibliche; esse rappresentavano dei tipi al confronto con gli uomini riconoscibili e ben collocati nel loro tempo a cui venivano accostate. Gabriele Paleotti ci ricorda opportunamente l’importanza di distinguere l’esecuzione di un ritratto dai suoi usi successivi: i ritratti dovevano raffigurare “persone la cui bontà morale o santità cristiana possa stimolare altri a praticare le virtù”<a href=\"/endnotes/#note-36\"><sup>36</sup></a>. La loro varietà permetteva agli studenti di analizzare le diverse forme di grandezza che un artista poteva incarnare. Il ritratto di Girolama aggiunge senz’altro una dimensione alla concezione che l’Accademia aveva delle artiste donne, pur restituendo una visione limitata della vera vita lavorativa o delle aspirazioni – forse indecifrabili – dell’effigiata.</p>\n<p>L’errore di Baglione ci porta a riflettere sulle strutture comunitarie in cui Girolama viveva e lavorava, mostrando quanto sia anacronistico ritenere che la collocazione del suo ritratto tra gli accademici implicasse un’uguaglianza, in termini di partecipazione alla scena artistica, tra lei e gli accademici con cui lavorava a stretto contatto. Tra questi, Antonio Tempesta, Francesco Villamena, Cristoforo Roncalli, e Giuseppe Cesari erano particolarmente vicini a lei e alla sua famiglia. Una cronaca della vita e delle opere di Girolama – comprese le poche immagini firmate che ci danno il senso del suo apporto nella bottega di famiglia e del suo ruolo nella produzione dell’atlante illustrato della vita intellettuale nella Roma della prima età moderna – non riesce a produrre una narrativa coerente del ritratto nell’Accademia. L’aspetto forse più singolare del ritratto dipinto di Girolama Parasole tra quelli degli accademici è che ci invita a riflettere in modo più aperto sull’identità degli incisori, sui loro comportamenti e sulle opportunità che si aprivano loro nella Roma della controriforma cattolica – opportunità che, entro certi limiti, la nuova Accademia trovò utile abbracciare.</p>\n","contributor":[{"id":"elincoln"}],"length":765,"title":"Conclusione","type":"essay","url":"http://localhost:8080/ParasolePrintmakingItalian/conclusion/"},{"content":"<ol>\n<li id=\"note-1\">\n<p>Caroline Jones, “The Artist-Function and Posthumous Art History,” <em>Art Journal</em> 76, no. 1 (primavera 2017): pp. 144–145.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"note-2\">\n<p>Jones (2017), p. 145, parla della coerenza percepita della “funzione-autore postuma” creata dagli storici.</p>\n</li>\n<li id=\"note-3\">\n<p>Giovanni Baglione, <em>Le vite de’ pittori, scultori et architetti.
